<p class='fs12 tac mb05'>CONTENTS</p>
<p class='sc t1'><a href='#chI'>Chapter I—Peace in the Coso Valley</a></p>
<p class='tocp'>Stacy’s dream is interpreted. Jim-Sam proves to
be a problem. A guide that could howl like a coyote.
“Mules, like some fellers, is contrary critters.” Sam’s
whiskers are expressive. A peace that was rudely
broken.</p>
<p class='sc t1'><a href='#chII'>Chapter II—On the Road to Trouble</a></p>
<p class='tocp'>The Overlanders prepare for defense. Stacy’s weapon
a tent stake. Emma Dean in the toils. The shot
that stopped the roper. “Let ’em have it!” yells the
guide. All because of the fat boy’s dream. The
alarm.</p>
<p class='sc t1'><a href='#chIII'>Chapter III—An Invitation to Move</a></p>
<p class='tocp'>“Sit tight!” orders Hippy. A caller who threatened
trouble. Sam Conifer passes the lie. “I reckon I’d
kill ye whar ye stand!” Hands flash to weapons.
The stranger is ordered out of camp. When brains
were mixed.</p>
<p class='sc t1'><a href='#chIV'>Chapter IV—At the “Circle O” Ranch</a></p>
<p class='tocp'>Camp made in the foothills of the Cosos. “The Old
Man wants ter know what ye are doin’ heah!” The

whiskers.</p>
<p class='sc t1'><a href='#chV'>Chapter V—Overlanders Suffer a Loss</a></p>
<p class='tocp'>“Shoot, Sam! Shoot, I tell you!” A mysterious
shot is fired. Jim finds a trail. A “lovely party”
spoiled. The Overland Riders find their ponies missing.

other.</p>

wounded. Tom bears bad news to his companions.
Elfreda gives first aid. Cowpunchers look on in
open-mouthed wonder.</p>
<p class='sc t1'><a href='#chVIII'>Chapter VIII—The “Dude” Makes Good</a></p>
<p class='tocp'>Hippy is complimented by Two-gun Pete. “What’s
a hoss when it comes to a scrap?” What Hippy
Wingate dreamed. Grace Harlowe’s pony is recovered.
Ranchers help the Overlanders to move.
Judy Hornby makes an exciting entrance.</p>
<p class='sc t1'><a href='#chIX'>Chapter IX—Judy Speaks Out</a></p>
<p class='tocp'>The mountain girl wants to know what love is. Judy
tries poulticing for a sick heart. “If I could talk
like that I’d be a real lady.” Overland girls give helpful
advice. A word that drove a mustang to desperation.</p>
<p class='sc t1'><a href='#chX'>Chapter X—The Round-up</a></p>
<p class='tocp'>“Pap sure was a scream,” declares Judy. The Overland
Riders witness a thrilling round-up. Stacy Brown
gets into new difficulties. J. Elfreda is accused of
frightening a wild steer to death. Bad news from
up the valley.</p>
<p class='sc t1'><a href='#chXI'>Chapter XI—Hippy Defends the Ranch</a></p>
<p class='tocp'>Lieutenant Wingate’s suspicions aroused. Two
ruffians are neatly trapped. The ranch-house under
rifle fire. A ruse that succeeded. “I’ve got to take
a chance.” Rifle bullets rip through the old house.
Disaster again overtakes the Overland Rider.</p>
<p class='sc t1'><a href='#chXII'>Chapter XII—At the Last Moment</a></p>
<p class='tocp'>An alarm scatters the mountain ruffians. “Hit the
trail! Hit it hard!” Cowpunchers find the ranch-house
on fire. A dramatic scene in Joe Bindloss’s
home. Captives give sullen replies. “The herd’s
stampeded an’ Pop’s been shot!” cries Idaho Jones.</p>
<p class='sc t1'><a href='#chXIII'>Chapter XIII—An Overlander Is Missing</a></p>
<p class='tocp'>Hippy at last regains consciousness. Lieutenant
Wingate relates the story of the attack on the ranch-house.
Cowboys howl when they hear the news.

have got away!”</p>
<p class='sc t1'><a href='#chXIV'>Chapter XIV—The Lost Trail</a></p>
<p class='tocp'>Malcolm Hornby refuses Joe Bindloss’s request.
“Pap’s got an awful grouch today.” Jim fails to
follow Chunky’s trail. The search is given up for
the night. Judy acts strangely. “Something has
happened to Jim!” Sam Conifer meets disaster.</p>
<p class='sc t1'><a href='#chXV'>Chapter XV—Clews That Were Loaded</a></p>
<p class='tocp'>The old guide finds the trail and a bullet finds him.
Stacy and Jim are among the missing. Two-gun

the carrier pigeons. Birds for a pie. “Wal, I’ll be
shot!” exclaims Joe Bindloss.</p>
<p class='sc t1'><a href='#chXVI'>Chapter XVI—The Carrier Pigeons’ Flight</a></p>
<p class='tocp'>Chunky writes a letter for the Rustlers. “This
suspense is killing me!” cries Emma. High ransom
is demanded for the fat boy. How to follow the
trail of a bird. The “dove of peace” is liberated.
“I’ve got it!” shouts Sam Conifer.</p>
<p class='sc t1'><a href='#chXVII'>Chapter XVII—Stacy Decides to Leave</a></p>
<p class='tocp'>How the Overland boy was captured. Mountain
ruffians make desperate plans. Money that came
down from the skies. “Put up yer hands, young
feller!” The fat boy in the toils. Stacy Brown finds
himself under arrest as a horse thief.</p>
<p class='sc t1'><a href='#chXVIII'>Chapter XVIII—Trouble at Red Gulch</a></p>
<p class='tocp'>Carrier pigeons point the way. The guide smells
smoke. Sam Conifer stalks the rustlers to their
lair. “Brown’ll be a dead dude by mornin’!” A
thunderbolt is hurled at the mountain ruffians.
Plotters get a rude surprise.</p>
<p class='sc t1'><a href='#chXIX'>Chapter XIX—A Duel in the Dark</a></p>
<p class='tocp'>The magician’s wand. “Yer too yellow to draw!”

trick!”</p>
<p class='sc t1'><a href='#chXX'>Chapter XX—Stacy Wields a Club</a></p>
<p class='tocp'>The fat boy’s story is not believed. “All hoss thieves is

himself.</p>
<p class='sc t1'><a href='#chXXI'>Chapter XXI—Judy Brings Tidings</a></p>
<p class='tocp'>A mysterious shot. Pete gets a bullet hole through
his hat. No trace of the missing Jim. Judy takes
her time in telling bad news. “Sam’s been killed
and Tom and Hippy wounded!” announces the
mountain girl.</p>
<p class='sc t1'><a href='#chXXII'>Chapter XXII— Riders of the Night</a></p>
<p class='tocp'>Overland girls go in search of the missing ones.

<p class='tocp'>Ponies become frantic with fear. Overland Riders feel

<span>PEACE IN THE COSO VALLEY</span>
</h2>

<p>“Does anyone know where we are at?”
wondered Stacy Brown, the last person
to leave his berth in the car that
morning.</p>

<p>“We are in the Coso Valley,” replied Grace
Harlowe Gray.</p>

<p>“I never heard of it,” returned Stacy. “We
are still in Southern California, I presume.”</p>

<p>“Of course. What a silly question!” interjected
J. Elfreda Briggs laughingly.</p>

<p>“Young man, we are nearing our destination.
If you don’t make haste you will be left,” reminded
Grace’s husband, Tom Gray.</p>

<p>“Left! What a tragedy!” murmured Emma
Dean. “By the way, Chunky, did you dream
last night?” she added, placing a hand on the
fat boy’s arm.</p>

<p>“Of course I did. What’s the fun in sleeping
if you don’t dream? I dreamed that I was the
King of England, and you should have seen—”</p>

<p>“Stacy!” cried Emma in mock horror. “How
unfortunate! To counteract the effect of that
unhappy dream, try tonight to dream that you
are a peasant. If you do not, some terrible misfortune
is sure to overtake you.”</p>

<p>“Piffle! Where do you get that stuff, Emma?
All right, Thomas. I’ll be ready by the time the
train stops,” added Stacy, addressing Tom Gray,
and moving on to the wash room, where he remained
until the train began to slow down for
Carrago, their destination. Carrago was a sleepy
little far-western town whose only excuse for
existence was that it was the only trading center
for the ranchers within a radius of many miles
in the broad valley that lay between the Argus
and Coso ranges, a remote section of the country
selected by Grace Harlowe’s Overland Riders for
their regular summer’s outing in the saddle.</p>

<p>The scenery that morning had held the attention
of the entire party with the exception of
Stacy, who had been too busy sleeping to give
heed to mere scenery, and the passengers were
already detraining at Carrago when he finally
came rushing through the car.</p>

<p>“Shall I brush you off?” asked the porter,
facing him, broom in hand.</p>

<p>“Brush me off?” frowned Stacy, who thus far
had avoided the porter. “Well, no. I reckon
that I’ll just get off in the ordinary way,” he
added, hurrying out to the vestibule of the Pullman
and down to the station platform.</p>

<p>“That was rude of you, Stacy,” rebuked Miss
Briggs, who had heard the boy’s retort.</p>

<p>“Rude? Huh! Do you think I want to be
brushed off the train?”</p>

<p>“Oh, Stacy! You are as hopeless as ever,
aren’t you?” laughed Grace. “Oh, this wonderful
air!” she cried enthusiastically, turning to
her companions. “Tom, aren’t you going to look
for the guide who was to meet us here?”</p>

<p>Tom Gray said that Hippy Wingate was attending
to that, and just then the Overlanders
saw him halt before two bewhiskered natives
standing on the station platform side by side and
assuming almost identically the same pose. Both
were old men. Their faces were seamed and
tanned, their shoulders stooped, and as they
stood with heads tilted back until their long
beards protruded at almost the same angle,
they presented a picture that made the Overlanders
smile.</p>

<p>“I am looking for Jim-Sam, who is to guide
us,” announced Hippy, addressing the men.</p>

<p>“We’re Jim-Sam,” answered the men in chorus.
“Be ye the dudes?”</p>

<p>“Well, not exactly,” interjected Stacy Brown.</p>

<p>“This is the party that engaged Jim-Sam,”
repeated Hippy patiently. “Which of you is
Jim-Sam?”</p>

<p>“Both of us,” added the taller of the two men.
“I’m Sam, an’ this heah galoot standin’ side me
is Jim, an’—”</p>

<p>“I’ll have ye understand that I ain’t no galoot,”
objected Jim heatedly, shaking a finger under
Sam’s nose.</p>

<p>“Hold on, you two! Let me get this clear,”
interposed Tom Gray, stepping up to them. “Do
you mean that we have engaged, not one guide,
but two?”</p>

<p>Sam explained that he and Jim were “pards,”
and that they had always worked together, and
“fit an’ died together” these many years, adding
further, that Jim, being a spavined, ring-boned
old cayuse wasn’t much good to anyone, himself
included, but that he could hold the horses and
howl like a coyote at the pack-horses to keep
them going.</p>

<p>“Haw, haw!” exploded Stacy.</p>

<p>“I don’t know about this,” muttered Hippy,
removing his hat and mopping his forehead.</p>

<p>“Are you two gentlemen heavy eaters?” questioned
Emma. “The reason I ask is, that we
already have two powerful eaters in this outfit,
and I doubt if we could stand to feed more like
them.”</p>

<p>“We kin rustle our own grub,” promised Jim.</p>

<p>“I suggest that we go into executive session
and talk this over,” urged Miss Briggs.</p>

<p>The suggestion was approved and the Overlanders
withdrew for discussion, Jim and Sam
holding their positions, apparently the most disinterested
persons on the station platform. Inquiry
developed that the salary named in the
letter of Jim-Sam covered the services of both,
so, after talking the matter over, the Overland
Riders decided to take on this strange pair to
guide them. The fact that the guides owned
their own ponies and pack-mules was an added
inducement. Otherwise it would be necessary to
hire or buy pack-animals.</p>

<p>Hippy Wingate told the guides that they had
been accepted, then he introduced each member
of the party to them. Nora Wingate laughingly
warned the pair that they were embarking on a
perilous undertaking when they set out with the
Overland Riders, whereat Jim-Sam’s whiskers
stiffened, but the owners made no reply.</p>

<p>Emma Dean, speaking confidentially to Hippy,
objected to guides wearing such long whiskers,
though she thought the men themselves might do
very well. Emma was of the opinion that such
whiskers were not sanitary, and averred that if
San Antone, who had guided them through the
Black Hills, were present he would correct the
fault by shooting off the whiskers without making
the slightest fuss about it.</p>

<p>Tom interrupted Emma’s conversation by
urging that the Overland ponies be unloaded at
once, the car containing them having, by this
time, been shunted to a switch.</p>

<p>“When do ye reckon on gittin’ out o’ heah?”
asked Sam.</p>

<p>“We shall be ready by the time you get your
mules and packs ready,” answered Hippy. “This
outfit moves without fuss, but it occasionally
makes quite a racket in doing so. Get busy,
boys!”</p>

<p>Jim-Sam turned away, still side by side, each
carrying himself with a dignity that made the
Overlanders laugh. While the provisions and
other equipment were being purchased by the
women of the party, Tom and Hippy unloaded the
ponies, and Stacy, uttering many grunts and
groans, piled their equipment on the ground near
the stock car. The ponies were then secured to
the tie-rail in front of the general store, where
they were looked over and felt of by every man
in the village, including several cowboys from
neighboring ranches.</p>

<p>During the unloading, Hippy and Tom had
noticed a cowboy sitting on a mustang some little
distance from them, observing the Overland
operations with keen interest.</p>

<p>“Who is that fellow?” asked Hippy of a
bystander.</p>

<p>The native shook his head, and the horseman,
seeing that he had attracted attention to himself,
jerked his pony about and trotted away.</p>

<p>“I don’t like the looks of that chap,” declared
Tom.</p>

<p>“I reckon he’s all right. Most cowpunchers
look tougher than they really are, though it is
quite possible that we may meet up with some
real rough-necks. I have heard that they are not
difficult to find in the Coso range,” replied Hippy.</p>

<p>“Oh, there come our heavenly twins,” cried
Emma, who had returned from the store with an
armful of packages.</p>

<p>Jim and Sam had just appeared dragging a pair
of unwilling mules, behind which, saddled and
bridled, trailed two long-haired mustangs. The
two men were alternately arguing and berating
each other and threatening the mules.</p>

<p>“What kind of an outfit is this?” wondered
Emma, her merry eyes regarding the scene.</p>

<p>“You may search me,” was Hippy’s laughing
reply. “Here come the other girls. Good
gracious! Where do they expect to stow all that
stuff? Jim-Sam, pull up here and sling your
packs. Is that as fast as those mules can travel?
If so you had better leave them at home.”</p>

<p>The guides were too busy arguing to give heed
to Hippy’s words, but when they reached the
station platform they took hold of the work with
surprising alacrity and began rolling packs with
skillful hands.</p>

<p>“What are they?” asked Emma, pointing to
the lazy mules.</p>

<p>“Jest mules,” answered Jim without looking
up, and Sam echoed his statement. “Don’t have
to have no names. When my long-haired cayuse
does somethin’ he oughtn’t, Sam gives him er
kick, an’ when Sam’s critter cuts up capers I give
his’n the boot.”</p>

<p>“No names?” wondered Emma. “Yes, but
what do you call them when you want them to
come to you?”</p>

<p>“Missie, what we calls ’em sometimes ain’t
sootable fer a young woman to hear,” grinned
Jim.</p>

<p>“Then kindly see that you do not call them,”
retorted Emma, turning away.</p>

<p>The Overlanders observed that their guides
now wore heavy revolvers and that the saddle-boot
of each held a rifle, which aroused apprehension
in the minds of at least two of the
girls. Jim-Sam, however, assured them that the
Coso Valley and the mountain ranges on either
side of it were as peaceful as “Sunday meetin’,”
and, further, that “nothin’” ever happened
there. Something did threaten to happen,
though, when it came to lashing the packs to the
mules, and Jim-Sam instantly became involved
in a violent argument as to how the packs should
be “thrown,” the two men in their anger shaking
belligerent fists under each other’s nose until they
nearly came to blows.</p>

<p>“If I had a disposition like your’n I’d go shoot
myself,” raged Jim.</p>

<p>“If I was a cantankerous cuss like you I’d go
live with the coyotes where I could snarl all day
an’ bark all night. Git outer my way afore I
soak ye in the jaw!” threatened Sam.</p>

<p>“That’s right, Sam. Hit him!” urged Stacy
Brown. “He isn’t any good.”</p>

<p>“Yes, he is, too! Don’t ye say nothin’ agin my
pardner. I ain’t standin’ fer nothin’ like that.”</p>

<p>“Here, here!” interrupted Tom Gray. “Stacy,
let these men alone and pack your pony. Jim-Sam,
you will stop your quarreling and do your
work or we may change our minds about taking
you along.”</p>

<p>“You understand, we wish to head for the
Bindloss ranch—the Circle O Ranch, I believe
they call it. We do not know Bindloss, but we
propose to get acquainted with him.” Hippy
grinned as he said it.</p>

<p>“This really promises to be a peaceful journey,”
observed Miss Briggs solemnly, whereat the Overland
girls gave way to the merriment that for
some moments they had been restraining, then
preparations for the start were resumed with
renewed speed and vigor.</p>

<p>Departure for the Circle O was made within an
hour. The Circle O was a ranch where a friend
of Lieutenant Hippy Wingate had put up while
on a hunting trip in the mountains some time
before, and it was because of what his friend had
told him of Old Joe Bindloss and his ranch that
Hippy decided to take in the Circle O on their
summer’s ride.</p>

<p>The start was accomplished to the accompaniment
of shouts and yells from Jim-Sam to get
the mules started and headed in the right direction
as well as to keep them going. It was a task
that proved too much for the old guides, who,
finally, after getting well out in the valley, rode
on ahead with the Overlanders. The pack-mules,
finding themselves being left behind, increased
their pace and soon caught up with the outfit.</p>

<p>“That’s the way with mules. Contrary critters
jest like some fellers I know of,” volunteered Jim,
giving Sam a withering glance. “If ye wants ’em
to go back’ards jest try to drive ’em for’ards.”</p>

<p>“An’ then agin, some fellers is so gosh darn
stubborn they won’t go either way when ye tells
’em to go t’other,” retorted Sam. “Folks, git
yer appetites workin’ fer we’ll soon be eatin’.”</p>

<p>Luncheon that first day was taken sitting on
the sand by a water hole, and was a brief affair,
for Jim-Sam had a camping place in mind, to
reach which meant a long, hard ride. It was
some time after nightfall when they arrived there,
and still later when the lazy mules dragged themselves
in, uttering long-drawn brays of satisfaction
or dissatisfaction or whatever it might be.
The animals were quickly relieved of their packs
and turned loose to roll and feed on the desert
sage through the night. All day long Jim-Sam
had argued and quarreled, and by the time they
made camp they had reached a point where they
no longer spoke to each other.</p>

<p>“What are we going to do with them?”
wondered Tom Gray frowningly.</p>

<p>“Keep them, of course,” answered Grace.
“Tom, they are a real treat, but if Stacy and
Emma do not stop stirring them up we may have
to send for the sheriff of the county. Just look
at them now,” she added laughingly.</p>

<p>Jim and Sam were sitting back to back unrolling
packs, each man muttering to himself his
opinion of the other. Later in the evening the
Overlanders got them talking and drew the guides
out. It developed that the pair had been prospectors
nearly all their lives; that they had loved
and fought each other for so many years that they
had lost count of them, and when their halting
story had finally been finished, the Overland
Riders looked upon Jim-Sam with new appreciation.
Emma Dean characterized them as a pair
of “beloved vagabonds.”</p>

<p>This having been their first day in the saddle
since the previous season, the Overlanders were
saddle-weary, and some of them were sore and
lame. Miss Briggs hobbled about painfully and
complainingly, and Nora Wingate lay by the little
campfire rolled in her blanket, the picture of woe.
Emma and Grace, however, appeared not to be
suffering the slightest degree of discomfort.</p>

<p>Jim cooked the supper, and it was a good one,
for he made biscuits and served them hot, soaked
in bacon gravy, a luxury to which the Riders had
not been accustomed. They made the most of
their opportunity, and Stacy Brown’s appetite,
as usual, was not fully satisfied until some time
after his companions had finished supper. Then
all hands gathered about the fire for a chat.</p>

<p>“Samuel, do you ever dream?” questioned
Emma after thoughtfully regarding the old guide
for some moments.</p>

<p>“Sure I do, Missie. I dreamed last night
that that critter—that ornery mule o’ Jim’s—kicked
the everlasting daylight out o’ me,”
growled Sam.</p>

<p>“Oh, you don’t mean it? That was fine,”
glowed Emma.</p>

<p>“Eh?” Sam’s whiskers stood out belligerently.
The old guide’s whiskers could express varying
shades of emotion.</p>

<p>“Your dream means that you are going to have
good luck—the best ever. Perhaps you are
about to discover a gold mine or a hole in the
ground where one has been, or something like
that,” bubbled Emma.</p>

<p>“Wrong up here again,” muttered Stacy
Brown, significantly tapping his head with a
finger.</p>

<p>“I should say that Emma has read one of those
five-cent dream books,” suggested Miss Briggs.</p>

<p>“It is my opinion that she has been fitting herself
for a lunatic seminary—cemeter—sanitarium,”
corrected Stacy.</p>

<p>“Tell us about it,” urged Grace, smiling over
at Miss Dean.</p>

<p>“I will if you folks won’t laugh at me. I am
a student of Professor Freud’s new science of
dreams,” announced Emma with dignity. “The
professor has demonstrated beyond question that
there is an imponderable quality within us—”</p>

<p>“You mean hot biscuit and gravy,” interjected
Hippy Wingate. “Since I overate this
evening I surely have an imponderable quality in
my midst,” he added amid much laughter.</p>

<p>Emma elevated a disdainful chin.</p>

<p>“I see nothing funny in a scientific discussion,”
she retorted. “As I was about to say when so
rudely interrupted, Professor Freud has conclusively
proved that every dream has its meaning—that
the imponderable quality in the subconscious
mind never ceases to work; that it even works
when we sleep, and—”</p>

<p>“Old Subconscious ought to join a union,” suggested
Stacy.</p>

<p>“And that, if we will but learn a few simple
rules, we shall be able to interpret those dreams
and be better able to avoid many perils as well as
to take advantage of real opportunities. Always
let the imponderable quality have its way,” urged
Emma.</p>

<p>Jim-Sam’s whiskers drooped, and the Overlanders
repressed their laughter.</p>

<p>“Perhaps you yourself might dream out the
solution of a mystery for us,” suggested Grace.
“I mean as to the identity and purpose of the
horseman who has been riding a parallel course
with us all day, evidently keeping us under
observation.”</p>

<p>The guides gave her a quick, keen look.</p>

<p>“Miss, I reckon as ye ain’t no tenderfoot,”
observed Sam dryly.</p>

<p>“A man following us?” cried Nora. “It has
come already! I knew it would. I knew that
trouble would follow this outfit, just as it has
done from the moment we set out over the Old
Apache Trail right on down until we ended our
vacation in the Black Hills last summer.”</p>

<p>Others of the party had observed the solitary
horseman, but had attached no particular significance
to his traveling in the same direction that
they were following.</p>

<p>“Watching us, do you think?” wondered
Emma.</p>

<p>“What about him, Jim-Sam?” demanded Tom
Gray.</p>

<p>“Wal, I reckons mebby he is the feller that
was hangin’ ’round when ye folks was unloadin’
at Carrago. He was a-snoopin’, an’ I don’t
reckon as he was doin’ it fer no good. I didn’t
like the look of him nohow,” growled Jim.</p>

<p>“Ye ain’t dreamed nothin’ ’bout that, has ye,
Miss Dean?” asked Sam.</p>

<p>“No. Not yet. However, in case it means
trouble for us either I or one of the others will
get a reaction in advance and—”</p>

<p>“Ha, ha!” laughed Hippy. “A reaction in advance!
That surely is a new one. Were Freud
to hear that he himself surely would have a bad
attack of nightmare.”</p>

<p>“I mean that one of us will feel that imponderable
quality stirring within us,” explained Emma,
her color rising. “We shall know. No harm
can come to us without our being warned in
advance. I—”</p>

<p>A volley of revolver shots punctuated the silence
of the desert night—shots close at hand, accompanied
by yells, hoots and howls, and the thudding
of many unshod hoofs.</p>

<span>ON THE ROAD TO TROUBLE</span>
</h2>

<p>“Merciful heaven! What is that?”
cried Nora Wingate, the color rushing
to her cheeks, then instantly
receding, leaving them blanched with fear.</p>

<p>The Overland Riders were, for the moment, too
startled to move, and it was Jim and Sam who
first sprang to their feet.</p>

<p>“Look out! They aire comin’!” warned Sam.</p>

<p>The girls ran for the protection of their tents,
with the exception of Emma Dean, who appeared
to be too frightened to stir. Tom and Hippy
were on their feet a second or so behind Jim-Sam,
each with a hand on his revolver holster, while
Stacy had disappeared on the dark side of his
tent. Stacy Brown always believed in safety first,
and he seldom lost many seconds in applying that
principle.</p>

<p>All this occurred within the space of a few
seconds, during which the shooting and the shouting
had ceased, but the hoof-beats of ponies
sounded much nearer to the camp. Then the
Overlanders saw them. Wild riders they were,
shadowy figures in the night, keeping just beyond
the flickering rays shed by the campfire, but
circling the camp, racing their mustangs. Once
more their shrill penetrating yells split the silence,
followed by a rattling fire of revolver shots.</p>

<p>“They’re shootin’ into the air. They don’t
mean no harm. Keep steady!” urged Jim.</p>

<p>“Shoo them off, Jim-Sam! Somebody will be
shooting lower than that if this keeps on for
many minutes,” warned Hippy Wingate.</p>

<p>“Git out o’ this, ye galoots!” yelled Sam as
one rider, bolder than the others, drove his pony
right through the camp. The animal hurdled the
campfire and ran between two of the Overland
tents. Yells from his companions greeted the
achievement.</p>

<p>The night rider repeated the performance, but
this time Jim-Sam fired at the same instant, one
bullet snipping off the rider’s hat, the other fanning
the hind hoofs of the pony.</p>

<p>“Now you’ve done it, you poor, crazy coyote!”
roared Sam.</p>

<p>“I didn’t. You did it yourself. I fanned the
critter’s feet,” retorted Jim. “Look out, they’re
comin’ fer keeps this time!”</p>

<p>They were.</p>

<p>The wild night riders had circled out on the
desert until joined by the man who had twice
ridden through the Overland camp, then they
drove their ponies straight at the camp, uttering
thrilling yells and shooting into the air. They
were upon the camp before the Overland Riders
fully realized what their attackers were doing.
The man in the lead rode down the little tent
beside which Stacy Brown was in hiding, and
Stacy, who had armed himself with a tent stake,
hurled it at the fellow as he passed. The stake
reached its mark—the neck of the rider—and
the man sagged in his saddle as the pony rushed
on into the darkness.</p>

<p>“I hit him!” yelled Stacy.</p>

<p>The rest of the riders went through with a rush.</p>

<p>“Do that agin’ an’ I’ll wing ye!” howled Sam.</p>

<p>The attackers did it again. The tents no longer
being a safe refuge, the girls ran out and stood
by the campfire so that the night riders might
see and avoid them. Emma stood a few yards
from them, where she had been standing since
the excitement began. This time the riders rode
down the rest of the tents, with weapons still
shooting into the air.</p>

<p>Sam had returned his revolver to its holster,
but a nervous hand trembled on the butt of the
weapon—trembled not because of any fear of
its owner, but because all the nervous tension of a
trained gunman was centered in it. The riders
were growing wilder with each passing second,
and Sam was growing proportionately calmer,
with shoulders slouched forward and whiskers
standing out at a sharper angle. It was plain
that nothing short of shooting with intent to
wound or kill could stay the orgy of those wild
night riders and their mustangs whose flashing
heels were a peril to every member of the Overland
party. Both Jim and Sam, knowing that
aggressive action on their part would bring down
the wrath of the riders, hesitated.</p>

<p>There came a moment, however, when restraint
was no longer possible. The horsemen had
cleared the camp and were turning for another
sweep over it when a rider on a dust-covered pony
came galloping into the light of the campfire.</p>

<p>“Whoo-pee!” he howled, his lariat in a great
loop spinning over his head.</p>

<p>“Look out!” roared Jim warningly, for he saw
where the rope was going to drop.</p>

<p>His warning failed of its purpose. The lariat
came down in a flash, and the great loop, holding
its form in a perfect circle, dropped neatly over
the head of Emma Dean.</p>

<p>At first Emma did not realize what had happened,
but as the coil suddenly tightened about
her waist she uttered a scream. Her feet left
their footing and Emma measured her length on
the ground, the coil gripping her tighter and
tighter, though the roper had checked the speed of
his mustang and was letting the rope slip slowly
through his hands.</p>

<p>Sam’s hand was trembling on the butt of his
revolver more agitated than before. The trembling
ceased suddenly, and there followed a twitch
of the wrist, a flash, and a sharp report. The
roper uttered a yell and let go of his lariat. Sam’s
shot had shattered his wrist.</p>

<p>Hippy sprang to Emma and freed her of the
lariat.</p>

<p>“Git down!” yelled Sam. “The varmits is
goin’ to shoot!”</p>

<p>The “varmits” shot lower this time, but every
member of the Overland party had taken to the
shadows and thrown themselves down, as the
rider who had roped Emma dashed out holding
his wounded wrist, yelling to his companions to
take it out of the man who had shot him.</p>

<p>By this time Tom and Hippy had gotten their
rifles and were watching and waiting, fully expecting
further and more serious trouble. It came
in the shape of another charge of the night
riders. This time their yells were savage. The
new note in them told the Overlanders what was
coming.</p>

<p>“Let ’em have it, fellers!” urged Jim.</p>

<p>“Girls, keep down!” called Grace Harlowe, as
Emma Dean once more stood up. “Isn’t once
enough for you?”</p>

<p>Emma permitted herself to sink to the ground,
just in time to avoid a rattling fire of revolver
shots from the raiders.</p>

<p>At this juncture, Jim and Sam let go with
their heavy revolvers, followed a few seconds later
by the crash of the two Overland rifles. That
some of their bullets had taken effect the Overlanders
knew by the angry yells of their attackers.
A rider’s pony went down on its nose at the very
edge of the camp and its rider plunged forward
to the ground, whereupon the pony staggered to
its feet and limped away, but the rider lay where
he had fallen.</p>

<p>“Jim-Sam, don’t kill ’em!” begged Tom Gray.
“Drive ’em off, that’s all.”</p>

<p>The fellow’s companions, leaning from saddles,
dragged the wounded man away, whence he was
flung on a mustang and carried off, but how badly
the fellow was hurt the Overlanders had no means
of knowing. They kept on shooting just the same,
backed up now by the weapons of Jim-Sam, and
it took but a few shots from the heavy weapons
to drive the raiders away.</p>

<p>“Now, ye infernal idiot! Do ye reckon ye’ve
done enough fer one night?” demanded Jim
sarcastically.</p>

<p>“I reckon I done too much when I saved yer
miserable hide from them raiders,” flung back
Sam. “Anybody git hurt?”</p>

<p>“I believe that I am the only casualty, but it
was only my feelings that were hurt by the fall
that my pride got,” replied Emma. “This is
indeed a peaceful valley, isn’t it, Sam? Nothing
ever happens here. Oh, no!”</p>

<p>Suppressed chuckles greeted Emma’s retort, but
Jim and Sam had already run out of camp to
make certain that the raiders had really gone
away. The guides found that they had departed,
but fearing that the attackers might return, they
decided to watch the camp for the rest of the
night.</p>

<p>The Overland Riders, acting upon the suggestion
of Sam, were putting out the fire and beginning
to get the camp in condition for sleeping,
when Stacy Brown strolled into the scene. He
had not been seen since the attack began.</p>

<p>“My tent is all down and torn,” he complained.</p>

<p>“So are others,” reminded Nora. “What shall
we do about it?”</p>

<p>“Nothing until daylight,” answered Tom
briefly.</p>

<p>“I suppose I am responsible for driving those
ruffians away,” boasted the fat boy. “I hit that
fellow an awful wallop with a tent stake when
he went past me, and that made the rest of the
gang more careful. Think of it! I didn’t have to
fire a shot to do it, either!”</p>

<p>“Yes. You did it all, little man. But if you
love us, never again dream that you are the King
of England or the Emperor of the Cannibal
Islands. I read in that dream of yours that something
terrible was going to happen. Oh, Sam!
That was a wonderful shot of yours,” she complimented
glowingly, turning to the guide as he
stalked in, combing his whiskers with his hand.
“It was perfectly adorable of you to shoot that
fellow after he had roped me. And such a shot!
Did you mean to hit him in the wrist or did you
shoot at the pony’s feet?” questioned Emma innocently.</p>

<p>Sam’s whiskers bristled.</p>

<p>“I reckon I hit what I shot at,” he answered
briefly.</p>

<p>“How wonderful! I wish I could shoot like
that.” She tapped his holster, and smiled up into
the weatherbeaten face.</p>

<p>“You kin. I’ll larn ye, Missie. You’ve got
the feel of a gun in yer make-up. We’ll talk
about it later on.”</p>

<p>“Yes,” agreed Tom Gray. “Other matters are
of more importance at the moment. What have
you to say about the attack on us? What does
it mean?”</p>

<p>“I reckon they aire a lot of wild cowboys that
wanted to have some fun with us,” drawled Sam.</p>

<p>“No. I don’t agree with you,” spoke up Grace.
“They were too savage for men bent on having
fun with a party of campers. I have been
wondering if the mysterious horseman, that kept
abreast of us all day, had anything to do with
the raid?”</p>

<p>“Cowboys on a spree,” persisted Sam.</p>

<p>“Ain’t no such thing,” interjected Jim, coming
in in time to hear his partner’s assertion. “Any
galoot with a spoonful o’ brains under his hair
would know better ’n that. Them’s wild horse
hunters!”</p>

<p>“Huh! Know it all, don’t ye?” leered Sam.</p>

<p>“Have to, bein’ as I’m hitched up with you.”</p>

<p>The laughter of the Overlanders put an end to
the argument of the two guides, following which
preparations for the night were resumed. It was
decided not to try to mend the tents until daylight,
which meant that some of the party must
sleep on the ground in the open. J. Elfreda Briggs
objected loudly.</p>

<p>“There are rattlesnakes here! I saw one today.
What if one should crawl into my blanket in the
night? I know I should die of fright.”</p>

<p>“Silly!” rebuked Emma. “If such a thing
should occur, I’ll tell you what to do. Don’t move
a muscle nor make a sound, but call for Sam, and
he will shoot the head off the reptile without so
much as disturbing your rest.”</p>

<p>“Emma Dean, your logic is overwhelming. As
a lawyer I fully appreciate it, and I thank you
for the suggestions. Without moving and without
speaking, I will yell for Sam and he will fan
my cheek with a bullet, and during it all I shall
slumber on as peacefully as a babe in its cradle.
Lovely!”</p>

<p>“Never mind the snakes. Turn in!” ordered
Hippy.</p>

<p>An hour later the camp was asleep and just
outside of it prowled Jim and Sam, halting to
growl at each other when they met on their
rounds. Only once during the night was the quiet
disturbed. About two o’clock in the morning
Jim-Sam heard a body of horsemen moving. It
was but a faint thudding that was borne to their
ears, and after listening for some time they heard
the hoof-beats die away in the distance.</p>

<p>“Glad we ain’t got to do no more shootin’,”
observed Sam. “Might wake up the gals and
that shore would be too bad. Say, Jim, that
little Missie Dean, with the freckled face like a
speckled trout, shore’s got spunk.”</p>

<p>“A-huh! Mebby she’ll lend ye some of it,”
retorted Jim.</p>

<p>“Shet up!” growled Sam, and strode away for
another round of the camp.</p>

<p>A pack of coyotes at this juncture barked in
a yelping chorus, and the Overlanders heard them
but only faintly, for it was now a familiar sound
to them after their many nights in the wilder
places of their native land.</p>

<p>Morning dawned bright and beautiful. The
day promised to be warm, and, as Elfreda Briggs
opened her eyes, her first thought was of snakes;
and her next, the sweet, pungent, penetrating
fragrance of sage which lay heavy on the morning
air. A cautious investigation showed that no
serpent had taken refuge in her blanket, whereat
Elfreda Briggs heaved a deep sigh of relief.</p>

<p>Sam stood a short distance from her, whiskers
standing out, shading his eyes with a hand as he
gazed over the surrounding country. He stood
straight like an Indian, and Elfreda found herself
studying this strange old man of the hills and
the desert—studying him with a new interest.
He was rather above medium height with the
small hips of a rider. His eyes were faintly gray,
and his was the lean, strong face of the man of
the open, a face that was lined with wrinkles,
and as he gazed there was a look of nobility about
it that held her fascinated.</p>

<p>The guide turned suddenly and saw her. He
smiled and passed a hand over his whiskers.</p>

<p>“What is it, Sam?” questioned Elfreda.</p>

<p>“Mornin’! Nothin’ but a little cloud o’ dust.
Might have been made by a hoss or a little wind pocket.”</p>

<p>The Overlanders now began to sit up and rub
their eyes.</p>

<p>“Breakfast is nigh ready. That no ’count
pard o’ mine is fryin’ the bacon an’ I reckon he’s
boiled the coffee till it ain’t fit to feed to coyotes,”
observed Sam.</p>

<p>“Do coyotes drink coffee?” questioned Emma,
blinking in the strong morning light.</p>

<p>“I reckon they takes somethin’ like that to
keep ’em awake nights,” answered Sam, whereat
the Overlanders laughed and began throwing off
their blankets, all now fully awake.</p>

<p>The camp looked to be a wreck, but a hurried
examination revealed that it was not as bad as
it looked. There were rents in the flattened tents
that would call for the work of the women to
repair, and some of the packs had been trampled
on by the raiding ponies.</p>

<p>It was decided to put tents and equipment
in condition before starting out, and this took
nearly half of the forenoon, so the start was not
made until after luncheon.</p>

<p>Not a human being had been seen all that
morning, nothing of a disturbing nature had
occurred except the dust cloud that Sam had
discovered. A few hours after they set out, however,
a horseman was discovered in the far distance,
sitting motionless in his saddle. He did
not move until the Overland party had proceeded
some two miles, whereupon he started along on a
parallel course.</p>

<p>“It is our mysterious horseman, I am positive,”
announced Grace, after a long look through her
binoculars.</p>

<p>At Hippy’s suggestion the party changed their
course and headed directly for the course that the
stranger was following. Shortly after that he
too changed his course. Several similar experiments
were made by the Overlanders, and always
with the same result. It became plain to them
that the mysterious horseman was keeping them
under observation, but for what reason not even
Jim-Sam seemed to be able to guess.</p>

<p>These deviations had carried the Overlanders
some distance out of their way, and to reach
their proposed camping place for that night would
necessitate traveling after dark, so the guides
decided to camp at the nearest water hole, which
proved to be located in the foothills. There the
foliage was greener and fresher, and bunches of
grass made fine grazing for the ponies.</p>

<p>Supper was an enjoyable affair that evening,
especially so because Jim and Sam enlivened the
occasion by wrangling over the way that Jim had
cooked the beans for their mess. Jim, finally
becoming too enraged to eat, got up and stalked
away, whereupon Sam gravely ate his own portion,
and then finished all that Jim had left.</p>

<p>The party had barely finished supper when the
familiar hoof-beats of a rapidly riding party of
horsemen were heard. The Overlanders were on
their feet in an instant, each member of the party
hurriedly throwing on his holster, then looking
to Jim-Sam for orders.</p>

<p>“I reckon nobody ain’t goin’ to do no shootin’
till I’ve had a first crack at the cayuses,” ordered
Sam.</p>

<p>The Overland Riders tensed their muscles and
their nerves for what they believed was to be a
battle in earnest.</p>

</h2>

<p>“They’ve stopped!” breathed Grace.</p>

<p>“One of ’em hain’t,” answered
Jim. “He’s comin’ on.”</p>

<p>“Jim-Sam, you sit tight, both of you. I’ll
talk with him,” said Hippy, stepping forward
a little to get the light of the campfire at his
back.</p>

<p>A man on a gray bronco rode out of the
shadows at a slow trot, and pulled up a few yards
from the camp where he sat surveying the outfit.
No one spoke, but the Overlanders were ready
for any hostile move.</p>

<p>After a few seconds the horseman slipped from
his saddle, tossed the bridle-rein over the pommel,
and clanked towards the Overlanders. Hippy
stepped forward to meet him. The newcomer
was short and swarthy. He wore a Mexican
sombrero, fancifully decorated; a gun swung at
his hip and a row of brass-tipped cartridges
showed in his belt. Black, searching eyes swept
from one to another of the Overland Riders,
finally returning to Hippy Wingate and resting on
him with a challenge in their depths.</p>

<p>“Well! Now that you have given us the once-over,
what’s the big idea?” demanded Hippy.</p>

<p>“Who be you?” snapped the horseman.</p>

<p>“I might ask the same question.”</p>

<p>“Don’t git funny. It ain’t healthy,” warned
the fellow.</p>

<p>“We are here for reasons best known to ourselves,
which can be of no interest to you. Are
you one of the party that attacked us last night?”</p>

<p>“No, I don’t know nothin’ ’bout that.”</p>

<p>“Then what do you want here?”</p>

<p>“To tell you to git out! You ain’t got no
business here. Pack up an’ mush out o’ this, an’
if you don’t do it fast enough I’ve got boys that’ll
help you along.”</p>

<p>Jim-Sam were getting nervous, but they were
obeying orders. Tom Gray stepped forward and
asked the reason for the stranger’s demand.</p>

<p>“These heah is grazin’ grounds fer stock, and
the man that owns them don’t ’low no others on
his land. Yer stock is eatin’ up the grass that
belongs to his cattle, so you’ll have to hike out
of this heah valley, and do it quick.”</p>

<p>“Stranger! Who is this feller that owns this
range?” drawled Sam.</p>

<p>“Hornby! Malcolm Hornby of the ‘Double
Q’ ranch,” was the prompt reply.</p>

<p>“Stranger, I ain’t particular ’bout stirrin’ up
trouble, bein’ an old man and a little rheumatic
in the joints, an’ ’specially in the trigger finger,
but what would ye say if I said ye was a liar?”
asked Sam half humorously, though the expression
in his eyes was not in harmony with his tone.</p>

<p>“I reckon I’d kill ye whar ye stand!” shot
back the fellow, flushing hotly under his tan.</p>

<p>“So?” nodded the guide.</p>

<p>“Is what this man says the truth?” demanded
Tom Gray, turning to Sam.</p>

<p>“This heah land don’t b’long to Hornby.
Mebby he grazes his stock heah, but this grass
don’t b’long to nobody. We got as much right to
graze our stock heah as he has, an’ that’s all that’s
to say ’bout it.”</p>

<p>“You have your answer, Mr. Man. I don’t
know your game, but it is my opinion that you
are not only what this gentleman has called you,
but that you are bad medicine as well,” declared
Tom Gray, looking the caller squarely in the eyes.</p>

<p>“Meanin’ that I’m a liar?”</p>

<p>“I reckon that’s about the size of it.”</p>

<p>“Get out of here!” commanded Hippy sharply.
“We can take care of ourselves.”</p>

<p>The stranger’s hand flew to his holster, but
there the hand paused.</p>

<p>“Easy thar! Don’t draw,” warned Sam whose
own right hand hovered near his weapon. “It
ain’t safe. You might hurt somebody, or mebby
I might hurt you, an’ that wouldn’t do nohow
before these young women who don’t like to see
a feller git hurt. But if you’ve got to draw, pint
your gun this way an’ mebby I ain’t too old or
my rheumatiz ain’t too crinkly so that I can’t
dodge yer bullet.”</p>

<p>The stranger’s hand closed over the butt of his
revolver and half drew the weapon from its
holster. It drew no further, for the fellow suddenly
found himself facing Sam’s weapon, which
had been drawn with a speed that must have been
a revelation to him, because his face reflected
amazement, as well as rage.</p>

<p>“If ye must shoot that gun off, take my advice
an’ come ’round in the daytime when ye can see
better, an’ we’ll fit it out man to man. But git!
This ain’t no company fer a feller like you who
can’t talk without a gun in his hand. Be ye
goin’?”</p>

<p>“Yes, but I’ll come back and you’ll be the one
to git,” the fellow flung at him, turning abruptly
on his heel.</p>

<p>“Hol’ on a minute thar!” commanded the
guide. “Don’t try to start nothin’ at all heah.
These friends of mine an’ these fine young women
has seen yer kind before an’ they’d as lief shoot
as not. Go back to Hornby, if he sent ye, an’
tell him to come out hisself if he is so tarnation
’fraid we’ll spile this grass. Jest a word more.
We’ll watch ye an’ if ye try any tricks we’ll shoot.
That’s all I’ve got to say to ye.”</p>

<p>“You’ll hear from me!” shouted the departing
caller as he flung himself into his saddle.</p>

<p>“I hear ye now, but yer voice sounds like as if
ye was afraid of somethin’,” drawled Sam.</p>

<p>The fellow rode away without another word.</p>

<p>“Follow him, Sam!” urged Grace. “We don’t
know but they may rush us, just as the raiders
did last night,” warned Grace.</p>

<p>“Leave it to Jim. He’s out thar an’ Jim kin
trail a canary bird without the bird ever knowin’
it. Jim’ll give us the word if them fellers try any
of their fancy tricks.”</p>

<p>“Oh, Samuel, why didn’t you shoot while you
had an excuse for doing so?” begged Emma.</p>

<p>The Overlanders laughed. They knew Emma
and they did not take her suggestion seriously.</p>

<p>Half an hour later, during which time the
Overland Riders had remained quietly alert, Jim
came stalking in, stroking his whiskers.</p>

<p>“Have they gone?” questioned the Overlanders
in chorus.</p>

<p>“I reckon they knowed what was good for ’em,
so they skedaddled,” replied Jim.</p>

<p>“Which way an’ whar did they go?” demanded
Sam.</p>

<p>“West! How do I know whar they went?”</p>

<p>“If you was half a man you would know. You
ain’t no more ’count, an’ not half so much use,
as that tarnation mule that carries yer pack. But
it ain’t your fault, an’ I reckon I oughter not set
so much store by you. A feller can’t be blamed
much because he was borned with half a teaspoonful
of brains in his haid,” raged Sam.</p>

<p>“I s’pose ye think you an’ that mule of yourn
has all the brains in this heah outfit. Wal, I
reckon you’re part right ’cause you an’ the mule
has got some brains, but when the Lord made ye
he got you two mixed. He thought you was the
mule, so he give you the mule’s brains an’ the
mule got yourn. I reckon—”</p>

<p>“Oh, shet up, will ye?” snarled Sam savagely,
tugging viciously at his whiskers, while a gale of
laughter swept over the Overland Riders. Jim
and Sam did not speak to each other again that
night, but glared as they met in their prowling
about in ceaseless vigil of the camp.</p>

<p>The next morning found the guides still deadly
enemies, but after breakfast Emma cleared the
clouds away by making a disparaging remark
about Jim to Sam, whereupon Sam promptly came
to the defense of his partner, and Jim heard it.</p>

<p>A late start was made, the guides having informed
their charges that they were only a few
hours’ ride from Old Joe Bindloss’s “Circle O”
ranch. An hour after the start they again
discovered what they believed to be their mysterious
horseman, but he disappeared shortly after
luncheon and was seen no more, and the Overland
Riders, making a sharp turn to the right, now
headed towards the purple haze behind which lay
the foothills and the mountains of the Coso range,
where adventure awaited them.</p>
</div>

<div class='chapter'>
<h2 id='chIV' title='IV: AT THE “CIRCLE O” RANCH'>
<span>CHAPTER IV</span><br />
<span>AT THE “CIRCLE O” RANCH</span>
</h2>

<p>Camp was pitched in the foothills about
four o’clock that afternoon. Grazing
lands stretched away parallel with the
mountain range as far as the eye could see, and
then were swallowed up in that everlasting purple
haze.</p>

<p>Farther along the valley in the opposite direction
they could make out the buildings of the
Bindloss ranch, to which Sam said they would ride
in the morning, as Hippy Wingate wished to
introduce himself to the owner.</p>

<p>Cattle were grazing all along the foothills,
hundreds of them, and those close at hand were
observed to have the brand of the “Circle O”
ranch. They were part of the great herd belonging
to Old Joe Bindloss, a rich rancher, a
hard man, according to Sam, but respected as a
just one.</p>

<p>Cowboys riding in to the ranch-house for supper
gazed curiously at the outfit that was making
camp, for it was seldom that anything of the
sort was seen in the Coso Valley. Arriving at
their headquarters the cowboys reported what
they had seen. Shortly after supper the Overland
Riders were again disturbed, and half a dozen
cowboys rode up in a cloud of dust, sweeping off
their hats as they pulled down their mustangs
at the very edge of the camp. Their attitude was
stern, but not unfriendly, and the Overlanders
surmised that they were from the “Circle O”
ranch, which they soon learned was the fact.</p>

<p>“The Old Man wants to know who you be and
what you are doin’ heah,” announced the spokesman.
“He ’lows thet he don’t like no strangers
foolin’ ’round whar the stock is, and he says it’ll
please him if you move on.”</p>

<p>“Say! This is a hospitable country, isn’t it?”
cried Stacy Brown. “Since I have been here,
about all I have heard is, ‘Get out or get shot
up!’ Funny thing about it, though, is that we
haven’t ‘got’ and we haven’t been ‘shot up.’”</p>

<p>“Be quiet, Stacy!” admonished Grace.</p>

<p>“Please go back and tell Mr. Bindloss that it
is Lieutenant Hippy Wingate, and his friends
from the east. Lieutenant Wingate is a friend
of Captain Gordon who was out here some time
ago on a hunting trip. Say to Mr. Bindloss that
if he objects to our camping here, we will go on
up into the range and make camp there,” answered
Hippy.</p>

<p>“Wal, the Old Man reckoned thet if ye didn’t
go we was to fetch ye back whether ye wanted to
come or not, but seein’ as thar’s ladies heah mebby
we won’t have to take only the men,” answered
the spokesman doubtfully.</p>

<p>“Listen, Buddy! You go back and tell the
Old Man to come and fetch us himself if he wants
to see us. Tell him Lieutenant Wingate said so,”
directed Hippy laughingly.</p>

<p>The cowboys hesitated, surveyed the Overland
outfit keenly, then, whirling their ponies, dashed
away towards the “Circle O” ranch.</p>

<p>“Another one invites us to get out,” murmured
Emma. “How exciting!”</p>

<p>An hour later a bellowing “halloo” informed
the Overland Riders that they were about to receive
another caller, and they surmised who it
was. The hail was answered in kind, then a
horseman trotted in and hopped off. He was a
big, powerful-looking man, his face hard, probably
from exposure, but the cold gray eyes now held
a sparkle that was reassuring.</p>

<p>“I’m Joe Bindloss. Where’s the duffer who
dared me to come after him?”</p>

<p>“I’m the duffer,” answered Hippy, stepping
forward.</p>

<p>“Shake!” rumbled Old Joe Bindloss. “Any
friend of Cap’n Gordon is a friend of mine.
We’ve had to be kinder careful out here lately
because there’s been some rustling done and the
word has been passed that there’s a big gang—a
regular gang of thieves, that’s working this
section under all sorts of disguises.”</p>

<p>“Meet <i>our</i> gang, Mr. Bindloss; every one a
rustler, but not the kind you are looking for,”
said Hippy laughingly. He then introduced the
rancher to the members of the Overland party,
and lastly to the guides. Bindloss peered at Sam.</p>

<p>“Wal, strike me dead if it ain’t Sam Conifer!”
shouted the rancher, extending a mighty paw to
Sam and another to Jim. “Do you folks savvy
this feller you’ve got here? You better savvy
him if you know what’s good for you. Sam, if
you want to do the ‘Circle O’ a great big favor
you just get wise to the feller that’s stealing stock,
but give him a chance to draw so you can plug
him proper. Come on up to the ranch-house.”</p>

<p>Hippy said they had intended to do so in the
morning, and then asked the rancher if he knew
a man named Hornby. Bindloss’s face darkened
and a heavy scowl wrinkled his forehead.</p>

<p>“I reckon I do. He and I don’t hook up nohow,
but he’s got a daughter that I reckon I wish was
mine. Judy is a peach and you ought to know
her. Why do you ask me about Mal Hornby?”</p>

<p>Tom Gray explained that they had been
ordered to leave the grazing grounds on the other
side of the valley, and that the demand had been
made in Hornby’s name. He also told Bindloss
about the raid of the night before.</p>

<p>“A-huh! Hornby ain’t got no call to tell you
to get out. A Mexican feller, you say? Probably
one of the half-breeds that you’ll find all over the
ranges, and a bad lot they are, too. I don’t
reckon Hornby had to do with that.”</p>

<p>“Who do you think the raiders were?” questioned
Grace.</p>

<p>“How do I know? I reckon, though, that
mebby they were sent after you. Somebody don’t
want you folks hangin’ ’round these diggin’s, but
I reckon that Sam Conifer can take care of them.
Eh, Sam?”</p>

<p>“I reckon, but honest, Joe, my rheumatiz
crinkles my fingers so that I can’t throw a gun
any more, let alone pulling the trigger,” complained
Sam.</p>

<p>Bindloss laughed uproariously.</p>

<p>“The feller who reckons on gettin’ you because
of your rheumatiz is a dead man before he
leaves home that day. Say, folks, the boys are
having a little shindy in the ranch-house this
evenin’, and they’d be mighty pleased to have
you all come over. The boys are a rough gang,
but they will treat you fine, you ladies.”</p>

<p>“What kind of a shindy?” asked Nora.</p>

<p>“A dance. They have a fiddle and a fellow
who scrapes it, and they may walk on your toes,
but they’ll feel worse about it than you do.”</p>

<p>“Oh, goodie! A dance! Of course we will go.
Come on, folks. Oh, Mr. Bindloss, do you ever
dream?” asked Emma soberly.</p>

<p>“Help!” murmured J. Elfreda.</p>

<p>“Why, yes. I reckon I do, like everybody else
does when they get outside of too much chuck,”
laughed the rancher.</p>

<p>“Do you ever make a psychoanalysis of your
dreams, Mr. Bindloss?” questioned Emma, laying
a hand on the rancher’s arm and gazing up into
his eyes.</p>

<p>“Eh? Eh? A what?” he stammered.</p>

<p>“You should learn to read your dreams. Freud
says that all dreams mean something—ungratified
desires in life—imponderable somethings
that may mean great happiness, great sorrows,
disaster—any number of fine or frightful things.
If you will tell me about your dreams I will search
out the imponderable quality in them and—”</p>

<p>“Ride out, Miss Dean! Quick! Use your
spurs because—”</p>

<p>“Don’t be alarmed,” begged Elfreda. “She
never gets violent. We are in hopes that the
mountain air may do her good.” The Overland
Riders burst out laughing, which, after a look at
Emma, Old Joe Bindloss joined in with a bellowing
laugh.</p>

<p>“Try that on the boys. They’ll be plumb
locoed,” rumbled Bindloss. “Are you going with
me?”</p>

<p>“Of course we are,” answered Emma.
“Where’s my horse?”</p>

<p>“I have ridden every foot that I am going to
ride today,” protested Miss Briggs. “Let’s
walk.”</p>

<p>The distance to the ranch being only about a
mile the Overlanders decided that they would
walk, and the rancher, assuring them that their
stock and equipment would not be disturbed,
Jim-Sam welcomed the opportunity to accompany
them. Bindloss led his mustang and walked with
them, and between Emma Dean’s quaint humor
and Stacy Brown’s broader fun-making, Bindloss
was kept in a roar most of the way home.</p>

<p>He explained that he had no family, and that
he seldom saw people of the outside world except
when he went to town, which was only at rare
intervals. He said that his men were preparing
for a round-up and that within a few days a bunch
of his cowboys would start with a drove of cattle
for the north. He led his new friends to the
dance-house, which was the cowboys’ bunk-house,
and there he introduced them to that rollicking
crowd.</p>

<p>The fiddler stopped playing the moment the
party appeared in the bunk-house.</p>

<p>Sierra Joe, Squint Nevada, Sallie, and Two-gun
Peters, were among the names that rolled readily
from the tongue of the rancher as he introduced
his men to the Overland Riders.</p>

<p>“And if they don’t talk you to death I reckon
they’ll dance you to death,” warned the rancher,
grinning at his men. “Scrape, you lazy lout!”
he roared to the fiddler.</p>

<p>The cowboys were shy, and stood about awkwardly,
avoiding the eyes of the girls who were
smiling invitingly.</p>

<p>“See here, boys, aren’t you going to ask us to
dance?” cried Emma. “No? Then I am going
to ask you. Two-gun Peters, I like your name.
It is a perfectly adorable name, and I want to
dance with you. If you are half as handy with
your feet as your name indicates that you are
with your revolver, we’ll have a heavenly dance.
Shake your feet, Peter!”</p>

<p>There was laughter from the Overlanders, a
bellowing laugh from Joe Bindloss and sheepish
grins from Two-gun Peters and his fellows, as
Emma grabbed him and began waltzing about
with him. Then the other girls of the party
selected their partners, and in a few moments the
cowboys were dancing, milling about as if they
were herding cattle at a round-up. Stamping
feet, shrill cries from the fiddler and an occasional
howl from Stacy Brown, who was doing an Indian
dance by himself, made the old bunk-house ring,
and raised the dust until the room was bathed in
a yellow haze.</p>

<p>Jim and Sam, grinning and pulling their
whiskers, were watching the fun and trying to
talk to Bindloss, but the old rancher was having
altogether too good a time to say much to them.</p>

<p>“I wish Judy was over here. She’d see somethin’
worth while,” he finally confided to Tom
Gray.</p>

<p>“Two-gun, do you ever dream?” Emma was
saying as she swept past them with her partner.</p>

<p>“Why—I—I reckon I do,” admitted Two-gun.
“Why?”</p>

<p>“Did you ever hear of a man named Freud, the
world’s most scientific interpreter of dreams?”
questioned the little freckle-faced girl gazing
soulfully up into the eyes of the big cowboy.</p>

<p>“I shore did heah of a feller of thet name. He
was a cattle rustler an’ I reckon he’s havin’ a
long dream, ’cause they caught him and hanged
him up on Rainy Mountain ’bout three year ago.
He shore was some rustler, an’ thar’s some others
of the same kind that aire goin’ the same way
when we kotch up with ’em.”</p>

<p>“Oh, no! That isn’t the man I mean. The
one I refer to is a great scientist who has discovered
that there is an imponderable quality in
each of us, and through his method of psychoanalysis
he is able to throw the spot-light on that
imponderable quality and—”</p>

<p>“Bang! Bang!”</p>

<p>Two quick shots fired from somewhere beyond
the open door of the bunk-house startled every
one in the room. One bullet passed through
Sam Conifer’s whiskers, and the other grazed the
dress of Emma Dean who was dancing past him
at that instant.</p>

<p>Sam’s weapon was out of its holster with a
movement so speedy that no one saw him draw it.
Two shots rang out from the guide’s weapon,
one shattering the hanging lamp, the other following
close upon the first, but fired through the
open door. The room was plunged into deep
darkness, with the odor of burnt powder heavy on
the air.</p>
</div>

<div class='chapter'>
<h2 id='chV' title='V: OVERLANDERS SUFFER A LOSS'>
<span>CHAPTER V</span><br />
<span>OVERLANDERS SUFFER A LOSS</span>
</h2>

<p>“Shoot, Sam!  Shoot, I tell you!” It
was Emma Dean’s voice that broke the
silence of the room. Sam’s answer was
lost in the chorus of yells uttered by the enraged
cowboys, who made a rush for the door, with
Joe Bindloss charging after them and shouting
orders.</p>

<p>“Get the critter! Drill him! Don’t let him
get away,” yelled the rancher. “You women
stay here till we find out what’s doing. There
may be some shooting, and there surely will be
if I ketch sight of the coyote who did that.”</p>

<p>Jim-Sam had strolled out behind the others,
the least excited of the party. They reasoned
that the person who fired the shot into the room,
evidently with the intention of hitting Sam
Conifer, would not be found outside waiting to
be caught. It was a pot shot and it had missed,
but the shooter, by this time, no doubt was well
on his way to safety.</p>

<p>Jim began snooping about, but the night was
too dark to enable him to find what he was looking
for, and the girls, not to be denied, stepped
out.</p>

<p>“Here! Take my pocket lamp,” said Grace,
thrusting it into his hand.</p>

<p>“Thankee, Miss,” growled Jim, and began
sweeping the rays from the lamp over the ground
in front of the bunk-house door. “Here’s whar
the critter stood when he let go,” announced Jim.
“Anybody recognize them boot-prints?”</p>

<p>No one did, and Jim went on nosing out the
trail, which he followed for several rods down the
valley, though the footprints were mixed with the
tracks of cowpunchers and ponies. Jim continued
his tracking until he reached a point where the
shooter had met and mounted a pony, on which
he dashed away straight for the hills. Those
hoof-prints were of keen interest to Jim-Sam.
They were the prints of unshod hoofs, and the
two men looked at each other with a meaning
gaze.</p>

<p>“I reckon the feller was shootin’ with his left
hand, an’ that’s why he missed,” observed Sam.</p>

<p>“I reckon,” agreed Jim.</p>

<p>“What have you got, Conifer?” called Joe
Bindloss, dashing up on his pony.</p>

<p>The men explained what they had found, and
the old rancher raged and stormed, declaring that
he would get the fellow, that he would set his
cowpunchers on the trail at once to follow it until
they did get the man.</p>

<p>“Ain’t no use,” objected Sam. “Can’t do
nothin’ till daylight, an’ then it’ll be too late.
I’ll know that hoof-print when I see it.”</p>

<p>“I reckon I know it now,” spoke up Jim.</p>

<p>“What’s that?” demanded Bindloss.</p>

<p>“You do?” wondered Sam.</p>

<p>“Shore, I do. It’s Mrs. Gray’s pony. He lost
a shoe yesterday an’ the others was loose, an’ she
was intendin’ to have him shod all around, after
I’d pulled off the rest of the shoes,” was the
guide’s startling announcement.</p>

<p>“Come back to the bunk-house. We’ve got
to find out about this,” growled Bindloss.</p>

<p>On their way back they met the Overlanders
coming along. Unable to restrain their curiosity,
the Overlanders had followed their guides down
the valley.</p>

<p>“Mrs. Gray, would you know the hoof-prints
of your pony if you were to see them?” asked
the rancher.</p>

<p>“I am quite certain that I would,” answered
Grace.</p>

<p>“Come and have a look at what Jim’s found,”
he said, wheeling his pony and trotting back
towards the place where the Overland animal
hoof-print had been found by Jim.</p>

<p>“Yes,” announced Grace after a careful
examination of the tracks. “Those are Ginger’s tracks,
or else Ginger has a double; but what was my
pony doing here? What does it mean, Sam?”</p>

<p>“I reckon it means that the feller who shot
at me had your hoss. Hark!”</p>

<p>A scattering fire of revolver shots was heard
from farther down the valley, and now Joe Bindloss’s
cowpunchers came riding from the ranch-house,
they too having heard the shots.</p>

<p>“It’s down by our camp!” cried Nora.</p>

<p>“Go to it, fellows!” shouted the rancher.
“You folks go back to the ranch-house, I’m
going to follow the boys,” he announced, spurring
his horse into a run.</p>

<p>Instead of following his direction the Overland
Riders started at a brisk walk for their camp.</p>

<p>“Aren’t we going back to finish our dance?”
wailed Emma.</p>

<p>“Not until we find out what is going on down
yonder,” answered Tom Gray with a wave of the
hand towards their camp.</p>

<p>“Oh, what a shame to spoil a perfectly lovely
party!” wailed Emma. “Two-gun Pete surely
could handle his feet even if they are big, and I
was having such a nice talk with him about
Freud, too.”</p>

<p>“Emma Dean, if you keep on I shall be in favor
of having your sanity inquired into,” threatened
J. Elfreda Briggs.</p>

<p>Stacy shook his head.</p>

<p>“You can’t inquire into what ain’t, can you?”
he demanded.</p>

<p>“No, and that is the reason you have never
been the subject of an inquiry,” flung back Emma
sharply.</p>

<p>At this juncture, Jim and Sam began to
wrangle, each accusing the other of being to blame
for the mess their party had gotten into, but the
Overlanders were too much concerned with their
own troubles to laugh at the argument of the
guides.</p>

<p>A few moments later the Overland party came
within sight of their camp. Someone, probably
men of the “Circle O” ranch, had built up the
campfire and could be seen moving about there.</p>

<p>As a matter of prudence, before leaving camp
that evening, the Riders had hidden their rifles
and ammunition, as they were in the habit of
doing. Their revolvers they wore, for experience
had taught them that it was the wise thing to do
in a wild country, or in sections where there were
ruffians such as they had encountered in the
Coso Valley.</p>

<p>“Is everything all right?” called Hippy as they
came up to the camp.</p>

<p>“No. Everything’s all wrong,” answered Bindloss
savagely. “I’ll kill somebody for this.”</p>

<p>“What happened?” begged Grace.</p>

<p>“My night rangers discovered some fellows
fooling about your camp, and knowin’ you was
at the ranch-house, because one of ’em had
watched you to see what you were doing, he
looked a little closer and saw the prowlers nosing
into your property. That was Idaho Jones.
Idaho fired three shots at the fellows, and that
called our other rangers nearby, who rode in hot-foot,
but the prowlers skipped before they got in,
though not before Jones had taken a few pot
shots at them. The thieves got away, but one of
the fellows says Jones was certain that he hit one
of them.”</p>

<p>“Yes. But what about our ponies?” cried
Grace.</p>

<p>“Not a hide nor hair of ’em left,” answered
Bindloss.  “The critters took ’em all, and one had
the nerve to ride yours, Mrs. Gray, almost over
to the ranch-house. You better look around and
see if they got anything else,” suggested Bindloss
amid a tense silence. “Jones and some of the
others chased ’em into the hills and are after
’em now.”</p>

<p>“The ponies stolen!” howled Stacy Brown.</p>

<p>“It’s your fault, consarn ye!” raged Sam
Conifer, addressing his companion. “I told ye to
stay here an’ watch things.”</p>

<p>“It ain’t! It’s your fault. If you’d had any
brains in yer empty head you’d stayed an’ watched
this camp. You need somebody to watch you, an’
that’s no lie!” yelled Jim at the top of his voice.</p>

<p>The Overlanders burst out laughing, some of
them a little hysterically.</p>

<span>RUSTLERS ARE HARD PRESSED</span>
</h2>

<p>“The mules is still heah,” cried Jim.</p>

<p>“Of course they aire, an’ I’ll bet
my mule scared them fellers off.
Thar ain’t a man livin’ that can git away with
that cayuse of mine,” declared Sam.</p>

<p>“Leastwise when he has mine to frighten them
off,” added Jim.</p>

<p>“I think you are right, James. Your mule would
frighten the beasts of the jungles,” said Emma.</p>

<p>“Missie, you’re wrong. Jim’s mule is the
finest chunk o’ mule flesh that you ever seen,” declared
Sam.</p>

<p>“You said it, old Whiskers. That critter of
yours can’t hold a firebrand to him,” agreed Jim.</p>

<p>“He can’t, eh? Wal, I’ll show ye whether he
can or not. Thar ain’t a mule on four feet that
can come up to mine,” averred Sam heatedly.</p>

<p>“Will you kindly stop your wrangling and do
something?” begged Tom Gray. “Hippy, are the
rifles safe?”</p>

<p>“Yes. They didn’t find them, thank goodness.”</p>

<p>Grace and her companions, who had been
making a hasty inventory of their belongings, announced
that not a thing was missing.</p>

<p>“I reckon that our boys got here too soon and
chased the critters away,” boomed the rancher.
“What do you folks think you’re going to do
now?”</p>

<p>“That is the question before the house,” observed
Stacy.</p>

<p>“Where would the horse thieves be likely to
take the stock?” asked Grace.</p>

<p>“No one knows where their hang-out is, but
I’ve heard that it’s up in the canyon country,
where it is said there are acres of rich grass and
plenty of hiding places, but nobody ever succeeded
in tracking ’em very far. They are too
smart. The boys won’t find ’em, but we’ll wait
till they get back.”</p>

<p>“Where is the canyon country to which you
refer, Mr. Bindloss?” asked Miss Briggs.</p>

<p>“On the other side of the valley in the
mountains.”</p>

<p>“Then is it not reasonable to suppose that they
will attempt to cross the valley tonight so as to
be in their lair by daylight?” persisted Elfreda.</p>

<p>“Sure they will,” agreed Bindloss.</p>

<p>“Can you spare enough men to ride back and
forth for a few miles on this side? It is possible
that they might intercept the thieves and possibly
recover at least one of our animals,” suggested
Miss Briggs.</p>

<p>“You’re right. Miss, you have a head on your
shoulders. Pete, you take all the boys that are
left here and hit it along the valley, stringing out
’bout half a mile apart and watch like all possessed,”
directed Bindloss.</p>

<p>“We want to be in on that, Mr. Bindloss. How
about ponies for Captain Gray and myself?”
asked Hippy eagerly.</p>

<p>“You can have the one I’m riding, and Nevada
will ride back to the ranch and get one for Captain
Gray. Hustle, Nevada! The rest of you fellows
go on, and don’t be afraid to string out. Sam, I
reckon you and Jim better stick around. No
telling what might be pulled off by that gang.
I’ve been thinking that mebby this is a sort of
come-back for Sam’s shooting that fellow in the
wrist the other night. I’ll bet it’s the same gang,
but there’s something more to it. I don’t know
what, but I reckon on you folks finding out one
of these days.”</p>

<p>“You may be certain that we will,” spoke up
Emma. “And please, Mr. Bindloss, try to remember
your dreams, for they may have a
powerful bearing on this affair. Each of you do the
same and tell them to me in the morning.”</p>

<p>“It ain’t dreams, it’s lead that’s goin’ to settle
this heah matter,” observed Sam.</p>

<p>Nevada soon returned with a mustang for Tom
Gray. The animal was not particularly good-natured,
and gave Tom no little trouble at first,
but fortunately he was not unhorsed, and the
party was soon galloping away, each man carrying
a rifle and fifty rounds of ammunition.</p>

<p>A few miles down the valley they were halted
by Pete and told to spread out between him and
the camp and keep a sharp lookout. Three rifle
shots were to be fired as a signal that the thieves
had been discovered. The men rode slowly back
and forth, hailing as they met at the end of
their beats, and thus the night wore on with
nothing more disturbing than the howls of coyotes
up in the mountains.</p>

<p>“Is it us that those fellows are howling
at?” questioned Tom Gray as he met Two-gun
Pete.</p>

<p>“I don’t reckon so. The breeze ain’t blowin’
right fer them to scent us.”</p>

<p>“Then it is probable that they are howling at
someone up in the hills, isn’t it?”</p>

<p>“Cap’n, I reckon as you aire right ’bout thet.
Somethin’ aire stirrin’. I feels it in my bones.
Can you folks shoot?”</p>

<p>“Pretty well when we can see, but not in such
darkness as this. Can you?”</p>

<p>“Shore I kin shoot in the dark, but thet ain’t
sayin’ I can hit what I’m shootin at,” chuckled
Pete.</p>

<p>While the Overland men and cowboys were
watching the foothills for the horse thieves, the
girls of their party were busy making their camp
comfortable and chatting with Joe Bindloss, who
found himself much attracted to them. Then
again, he felt it wise to remain with them until
the men returned.</p>

<p>Jim-Sam were striding back and forth with
“ears pricked up, jest huntin’ fer trouble,” as
they listened to sounds of the night rather than
to what those about them were saying. Both men
finally sat down in the shadows on the mountain
side of the camp, but not a word did either man
have to say.</p>

<p>“May I sit down with you boys?” asked
Emma, skipping over to them. “You are expecting
something, I know, and I would just love
to be in on it.”</p>

<p>“Please, Missie, git back,” urged Sam.
“Mebby nothin’ll happen. Most likely nothin’
will, but we got to listen and watch, fer—Skip!”
he added in a whisper.</p>

<p>Jim felt his companion stiffen ever so little,
and Emma, observing the expression on his face,
without another word, turned and ran back to
her companions. Sam had heard something, and
Jim’s nod indicated that he too heard it, but
neither man moved from his position, though
Sam Conifer’s hand might have been seen caressing
the big revolver butt that protruded from his
holster.</p>

<p>Over yonder by the campfire there were chatter
and joking and laughter, the old rancher being
entertained as he had not been in many years,
in fact not since he was a youngster in Illinois
where he had been born and reared. Jim-Sam
now heard nothing of the merriment, every
faculty being bent on the slight rustling that both
could hear in the bushes to the rear of them. It
was not the breeze that was stirring the foliage,
for there was no breeze, and they knew that it
was either man or animal creeping up on them,
though neither man could be certain that their
own presence, there in the shadows, had been
discovered.</p>

<p>Sam suddenly decided that the time for action
was at hand. With one of those marvellously
flashing movements that seemed so little a part
of him, the old man jerked his weapon from its
holster and fired back over his shoulder into the
bushes without even looking around.</p>

<p>Nora uttered a scream, and the other girls
sprang to their feet, while Joe Bindloss, uttering
a roar, charged towards the guides, both of whom,
now having risen, were shooting into the bushes.
Bindloss suddenly realized that the firing was not
one-sided, for he heard bullets zing past his ears.
The Overland girls also at once discovered that
they were under fire—revolver fire—and springing
away from the campfire, they threw themselves
prone on the ground.</p>

<p>The rancher at this juncture took a hand in
the shooting. The Overland girls, despite their
fright, gazed at him in admiration. Bindloss,
standing in the light of the campfire, was working
his revolver, firing at the flashes he saw coming
from the bushes. He made a splendid mark, but
nothing touched him, though twice Jim-Sam
heard grunts in the bushes, that told that someone
there had been hit.</p>

<p>“I can’t stand this!” cried Emma. “I’m
going to get my rifle.”</p>

<p>“Lie still!” commanded Grace. “Let the men
do the fighting. If they need us we shall know it,
and that will be time enough.”</p>

<p>Emma sank back, complaining to herself.
Stacy was nowhere in sight, but they knew that
he was in hiding, for he had disappeared at the
first shot fired by Sam Conifer.</p>

<p>The firing from the bushes ceased suddenly,
the defense of the camp probably having grown
too warm, as the Overlanders reasoned out the
situation. Now the three men fairly riddled the
bushes with their shooting, sweeping the entire
spread of foliage for several yards to the right
and left of them.</p>

<p>A sharp cry from one of the girls drew the
attention of Jim-Sam and Joe Bindloss to them.</p>

<p>“Horses!” shouted Grace.</p>

<p>The three men instantly divined her meaning.
The attackers had taken to their mounts, and,
with quick perception of what their defenders’
next action would be, the Overland girls snatched
up rifles and thrust them into the hands of the
men as the latter ran for the open.</p>

<p>The heavy report of a rifle before the three men
were clear of the camp, was the first intimation
that Stacy Brown had come out of hiding. He
was shooting at the retreating horsemen, now
that it was reasonably safe for him to do so. A
few seconds later Jim-Sam and Joe Bindloss were
firing at the sound of retreating hoof-beats, and
they kept on firing until the hoof-beats finally
died away.</p>

<hr class='tbk' />

<p>“Hark!” exclaimed Tom Gray as the sound
of rifle fire from the Overland camp reached them.</p>

<p>“I heah it,” answered Two-gun Pete. “Rifles!
They aire at it fer keeps.”</p>

<p>“Then let’s go. Man, they need us!” urged
Tom, his tone reflecting his excitement.</p>

<p>“Wait! Hold yer hosses fer a bit.”</p>

<p>They heard the few answering scattering shots
fired by the fleeing attackers; then the firing died
out. Pete, with head cocked to one side, interpreted
the sounds and the silence aright.</p>

<p>“Yer folks have got ’em on the run. Reckon
we’ll be goin’. Jest jog along so thet we don’t
run into somethin’ headlong,” he advised.</p>

<p>Tom Gray, worried and full of eagerness to get
into action, had to put a firm check on himself
to keep from racing on in the lead of his companion.
Ahead of them somewhere they knew
that Hippy Wingate was on the lookout for the
horse thieves, and so long as nothing was heard
from him there appeared to be no need for haste,
but while Tom’s every faculty was centered on
what lay ahead of them, Two-gun Pete, like the
mustang he was riding, gave as much attention to
the rear as he did to what was ahead.</p>

<p>A flash suddenly leaped up in the darkness
ahead, followed by a sharp report. Then guns
banged with a speed that reminded Tom Gray of
nights on the firing line in France.</p>

<p>“He’s met ’em! Ride!” yelled Two-gun Pete,
putting spurs to his horse.</p>

<p>Tom needed no urging, nor did his pony. The
little animal uttered a whistling snort and plunged
ahead, its nose at the flank of Pete’s flying
mustang.</p>

<div id='i002' class='illus' style='margin-left:15%; width:70%'>
  <img src='images/i002.jpg' alt='' />
  <p class='sm'>“He’s Met ’Em! Ride!”</p>
</div>

<p>“He’s turned ’em!” flung back Pete. “They
aire headin’ ’cross the valley. That feller shore
has got nerve.”</p>

<p>No more was said, but both men swerved their
mounts farther out into the valley to head off
the fleeing horsemen, and drew up on them slowly.
Pete saw that Hippy Wingate was fighting with
all the odds against him, but that he was holding
his own. Had there been light, the Overlander
would have been in a much more serious situation.</p>

<p>As the two men neared the scene of the fighting,
Tom Gray uttered a long-drawn yell, which Hippy
heard, recognized, and answered. The attackers
heard too, and put on a fresh burst of speed.
Observing this, Pete jerked his rifle from its
holster and emptied his magazine at them. Up
to this time, however, Tom Gray had not fired.</p>

<p>“No use. We aire losin’ ground,” shouted
Pete. “Ride till we git close enough to use the
barkers. I never was no good at long-range
shootin’.”</p>

<p>A few moments later the horses of the ruffians
became faintly discernible, and Pete rode straight
at them. The ruffians were shooting as they
raced, and Lieutenant Hippy Wingate was banging
away at them and yelling like an Indian on
the warpath. About this time Tom and Pete
opened up with their revolvers. A pony went
down and its rider was seen to plunge over its
head. Pete jerked his mustang aside just in
time to avoid running into the fallen man and
horse. There were fully half a dozen of the supposed
horse thieves, some of whom were leading
other animals behind them, and it was these to
whom Pete devoted his attention, believing that
the led horses were stolen animals.</p>

<p>The three pursuers were spread out in fan shape
now, Hippy Wingate on the extreme right,
running in on the fleeing men head-on, then
ducking and swinging out, after emptying his
weapon at them.</p>

<p>“Hit!” he muttered as a sudden burning sensation
was felt in the calf of his left leg. “Take
that!” he yelled. Taking a desperate chance he
rode right in among the scattered horsemen,
hoping to cut them off and give his own companions
an opportunity to do more effective work.</p>

<p>Hippy emptied two revolvers at the raiders,
then all at once something suddenly seemed to
snap in his head, and Hippy Wingate reeled in his
saddle. Sudden and deeper darkness enveloped
him, and Hippy fell forward on the neck of his
mustang, both feet slipping from the stirrups.
For a moment he clung there. He did not hear
the scream of his pony as a bullet hit the plucky
little animal, nor did he feel the impact when
both he and the pony went down in the dust and
lay motionless where they had fallen.</p>
</div>

<div class='chapter'>
<h2 id='chVII' title='VII: A FIGHT TO A FINISH'>
<span>CHAPTER VII</span><br />
<span>A FIGHT TO A FINISH</span>
</h2>

<p>“They are heading for the mountains!”
shouted Tom as he and Two-gun
Pete drew together.</p>

<p>“Yes, but we’ll chase ’em into the foothills
afore we quit,” raged Pete. “Ain’t hit, be ye?”</p>

<p>“No.”</p>

<p>“Thet’s good.”</p>

<p>The two riders again settled down to their work,
pushing their ponies to utmost speed. Then they
observed that the ruffians were beginning to
spread out, to scatter, a move that Two-gun Pete
understood perfectly. They were planning to
take to the mountains as individuals rather than
as a body. This would make pursuit more difficult,
in fact, practically impossible.</p>

<p>Both Tom and Pete had had many close calls
from bullets, but neither gave much heed to them.
They were too busy to consider something that
had passed, and again, they had advantage in
that they were pursuing while their adversaries
were fleeing before them.</p>

<p>“Now give ’em the rifles!” yelled Pete as the
pursued riders neared the foothills. “Keep
shootin’!”</p>

<p>The pair unlimbered their rifles, and soon
afterwards other cowpunchers who had joined
them did the same. The heavy firing was plainly
audible to the girls of the Overland party, who,
fearing for their companions, were very nervous,
and Joe Bindloss paced back and forth at the
camp listening, his face stern, both hands
tightly clenched.</p>

<p>“I hope they kill some of them devils! I
hope they do!” he growled.</p>

<p>In the meantime Tom Gray and the cowpunchers
were at it hammer and tongs, nor did
they cease firing until the last of the supposed
horse thieves were out of sight in the deep
shadows in the foothills.</p>

<p>“I reckon thet’s about all,” observed Two-gun
Pete dryly. “What I wants to know is whar
thet fightin’ friend of yours is.”</p>

<p>“Can’t we give Lieutenant Wingate a gun
signal to come in?” asked Tom, a note of anxiety
in his tone.</p>

<p>“No. Thet will be givin’ notice to them
critters thet we’ve finished this heah little game,
an’ I don’t want them to have thet satisfaction.
We’ll mosey about a little an’ see if we kin find
Mr. Wingate.”
Pete, followed by Tom, worked up and down
the valley parallel with the mountain ranges for
some little time without discovering Hippy; then
all of a sudden, Pete uttered a <i>whoo—pe-e-e!</i>
It was answered instantly, and two men rode
cautiously out of the darkness. They proved to
be Sierra Joe and Nevada, who said the others
were somewhere to the north. A distant hail told
the men that the others also had heard Pete’s
call and were heading in his direction. Tom,
worried as he was about Hippy, could not but
admire the efficient manner in which these men
of the open worked. It was a revelation to him.
Shortly after that the rest of the party rode in.</p>

<p>“Has any of you cayuses seen anythin’ of the
Old Man’s friend?” questioned Pete.</p>

<p>“Is he the feller that was workin’ to the
south?” asked Nevada.</p>

<p>“Yes,” spoke up Tom.</p>

<p>“Wal, he quit firin’ some little piece back thar.
I reckon mebby he got winged,” announced
Nevada.</p>

<p>“Line up, fellers! Take yer ranges by the hills
on the other side of the valley and look sharp.
I reckon mebby thar’s some other things to find
in this heah valley,” added Pete significantly.</p>

<p>The search for Hippy began without a moment’s
delay, fast and efficient, but without a
trace of excitement. The attitude of his
companions steadied Tom and assisted him to keep
his head clear.</p>

<p>Two dead ponies were found first by Sierra,
and near them lay two men, both dead. Sierra
hailed his companions and when they arrived he
struck a match to look at the victims.</p>

<p>“Chuck the light!” commanded Pete sternly.</p>

<p>The words were barely past his lips when a
bullet <i>pinged</i> through the air over their heads.</p>

<p>“Ain’t you got no sense, Sierra?” demanded
Pete disgustedly. “Don’t ye do thet agin.
Them fellers aire waitin’ fer us to give them a
show, an’ I reckon they’ll hang out in the foothills
fer some time yit. Anybody know these
critters?”</p>

<p>Each cowboy took a look at the victims, but
none recognized them. The brand on the dead
mustangs also was unknown to them.</p>

<p>“Can’t do nothin’ till daylight. Hit the trail
agin,” ordered Pete, whereupon the search for
Hippy Wingate was resumed. It was Tom Gray
who found him, nearly a mile from their last
stand.</p>

<p>“Help here!” shouted Tom.</p>

<p>Pete heard and understood. With the others,
he spurred to the scene, finding Tom Gray on the
ground bending over the stretched-out form of
the fallen Overlander.</p>

<p>“Is he daid?” questioned Sierra anxiously.</p>

<p>“No. He is alive, but he must be badly hurt.
He has been here for some time and is still unconscious.
That looks bad. Boys, we must get
him to camp as quickly as possible. How shall
we do it?”</p>

<p>“I’ll take him on my ’tang,” answered Pete.
“Wait till I git up; then boost him up to me and
I’ll do the rest. Nevada, you ride back a piece
to make sure thet we ain’t followed, an’ give us a
good start. You kin come on in then.”</p>

<p>Hippy’s limp form was lifted into Two-gun
Pete’s arms, and giving the pony the reins, Pete
touched the animal with a light spur and the
journey back to camp was begun. It was not
a gentle ride for the wounded Overlander. In
fact it was a killing ride, and when they came
in sight of the campfire, the pony was white with
lather.</p>

<p>It was at this juncture that Hippy began to
mutter and struggle.</p>

<p>“Thet’s all right, pard. Yer on yer way back
to camp, and Pete’s the boy thet’s takin’ ye; so
jest rest easy-like. Cap, ride in an’ tell ’em we
aire comin’.”</p>

<p>Tom spurred ahead, and by the time Pete and
his burden rode in, the Overlanders were ready
to receive them. All were pale, though Nora,
who might have been expected to go to pieces, was
calm, in fact fully as much so as Elfreda and
Grace who, as hospital workers in the great war,
were used to scenes of this sort.</p>

<p>Hippy’s face, as he was lifted from Two-gun
Pete’s arms, was seen to be covered with blood.</p>

<p>“Place him by the fire where we can see,”
directed Grace. “Stacy, fetch water, and be
quick about it!”</p>

<p>“I’ll get my kit and be back in a moment,”
announced Elfreda.</p>

<p>Blankets were spread out by the campfire, and
on them the wounded Hippy was laid, and by the
time Elfreda returned, Grace had sponged away
the blood from his face and head.</p>

<p>“A bullet has laid his scalp open on the right
side,” she announced. “If there are no other
wounds he will pull through all right. Do you
hear me, Hippy?”</p>

<p>“Ye—es.”</p>

<p>“Is this the only wound you have?”</p>

<p>“No. In leg,” answered the patient weakly.</p>

<p>Nora pulled up the trousers from both limbs
and discovered that the left one was bloody from
half way below the knee down, and it was Nora’s
hands that washed the wound clean and prepared
it for the dressing.</p>

<p>Elfreda Briggs, by this time, had returned with
her first-aid kit, and was critically examining the
scalp wound, Grace Harlowe standing over her
with face full of interest and sympathy.</p>

<p>“This must be sewed up as soon as we have
treated it,” announced Miss Briggs, nodding up
at her companion. “Hippy, I shall have to take
several stitches in your scalp, and I am going to
hurt you. You won’t mind, will you, after all
the fun you have been having tonight?”</p>

<p>“Get it over with,” muttered Hippy.</p>

<p>“Grace, you might dress the leg while I am
doing this embroidery work for Hippy. Did the
bullet go all the way through the leg?”</p>

<p>“Ye—es,” replied Nora. “I—I think so.”</p>

<p>“It did, through the fleshy part. It is not a
bad wound,” volunteered Grace.</p>

<p>Miss Briggs began her work at once, and performed
it quickly and skillfully. Hippy, despite
himself, flinched under each needle thrust. A
group of wondering, open-mouthed cowpunchers
watched the Overland girl perform her operation,
and by the time she had finished stitching the
scalp together, Grace had completed her task on
the leg wound.</p>

<p>“Oh! He’s dead!” cried Nora, after a quick
look into Hippy’s now ghastly pale face.</p>

<p>“Don’t get excited! He has fainted, that’s
all,” comforted Miss Briggs, who thereupon proceeded
to revive her patient. The pain had
been a little more than Hippy, in his weakened
condition, could bear, and under it he had
swooned.</p>

<p>Old Joe Bindloss clutched off his sombrero and
mopped the perspiration from his forehead.</p>

<p>“Wal! I’ve seen some things in my time, but
I’ll be shot for a hoss thief if I ever come up with
the like of this,” rumbled the rancher.</p>

<p>Hippy opened his eyes and a faint grin appeared
on his face, whereat, the cowpunchers, as one man,
heaved a deep breath of relief. They stood about
awkwardly, sombreros tucked under their arms,
not knowing what they ought to do, but quite
positive to a man that they wished there were
more patients to be treated so that they might
stay where they were and watch these capable
young women work for the rest of the night.</p>
</div>

<h2 id='chVIII' title='VIII: THE “DUDE” MAKES GOOD'>
<span>CHAPTER VIII</span><br />
<span>THE “DUDE” MAKES GOOD</span>
</h2>

<p>Two-Gun Pete sidled over to Hippy.</p>

<p>“Fer a dude, yer some scrapper. I’ll
say so. Shake, Pard,” he said, extending
a ham-like paw.</p>

<p>“Yep! Reg’lar bear-cat,” agreed Sierra, and
all the cowboys nodded solemnly.</p>

<p>“Thanks! Did we get any of them?” questioned
Hippy, not much above a whisper, for
every word sent shooting pains through his head.</p>

<p>“Two thet we knows of, and mebby some more.
The Old Man’s hoss thet you was ridin’ got his’n,
too.”</p>

<p>“Oh, that is too bad. I’m sorry.”</p>

<p>“Thet ain’t nothin’,” interjected Idaho.
“What’s a hoss when it comes to a scrap with a
bunch of rustlers? They’re mad now, and we’ll
mebby git another chance at ’em some day soon.
Reckon you won’t care ’bout mixin’ in agin?”</p>

<p>“I reckon you have another guess coming,
Idaho,” answered Hippy, grinning.</p>

<p>Bindloss here interrupted by declaring that the
wounded Overlander must be taken to the ranch-house
and put to bed. He said he would have a
buckboard brought down and fetch him. Miss
Briggs shook her head.</p>

<p>“I do not think best to have him moved tonight.
If he feels better in the morning, you may
do that,” she said.</p>

<p>“All right. You’re the doctor. I’ll have the
boys fix you up comfortable and stand guard for
the rest of the night so you won’t be bothered by
those rustlers.”</p>

<p>“Bindloss, I am sorry about the pony that got
shot under me. Of course I shall pay you for
him,” offered Hippy.</p>

<p>“Pay nothing!” roared the rancher. “I owe
you money for the walloping you folks give those
coyotes. Here, you rough-necks! Fix these folks
up with whatever they want, then spread out and
ride ’round for the rest of the night, and if they
get into any more trouble tonight, I’ll fire the
bunch of you and get riders who can see and
shoot.”</p>

<p>“I reckon we kin take care of our folks and do
whatever is necessary,” interjected Sam.</p>

<p>Bindloss agreed, but said his men would be
on guard just the same. Shortly after that the
cowboys mounted and rode out into the valley
for their night’s vigil.</p>

<p>A tent was erected over Hippy, and Nora
insisted on sitting up to look after him, but before
turning in the Overlanders went into Hippy’s
tent with a cheerful word for their wounded
companion.</p>

<p>“Hippy, tell me, did you dream anything when
you were asleep out there after being shot?”
whispered Emma.</p>

<p>“Yes. I dreamed that an imponderable quantity
appeared suddenly out of the nowhere and
gave me an awful wallop,” retorted Hippy.</p>

<p>“I think you are real mean,” pouted Emma.
“Good-night! Don’t forget to remember what
you dream about tonight, for it may be of great
importance to us.”</p>

<p>“Huh!” muttered Hippy.</p>

<p>Soon after that the camp became quiet and
every Overlander, except Nora, was sound asleep.
Jim-Sam, however, were just outside holding a
heated argument over the occurrences of the
evening. Jim blamed Sam for shooting into the
bushes and thus starting the row that ended in
the wounding of one of their party.</p>

<p>“Why, you miserable galoot, you ain’t got the
sense of a flea!” retorted Sam. “If it hadn’t
been fer me, you’d been quarrelin’ with the angels
right this minute. Some folks ain’t got brains
enough to know nothin’.”</p>

<p>“You said it,” agreed Jim. “I’ve knowed that
ever since I’ve been with ye.”</p>

<p>The argument was continued at intervals all
the rest of the night, and until at break of day
they saw the cowpunchers ride off down the valley
at a brisk gallop. Jim then built up the fire and
began preparing for breakfast. The odors of the
cooking soon awakened the Overlanders, and one
by one they turned out rubbing the sleep out of
their eyes.</p>

<p>Emma Dean’s face, however, was glowing and
her eyes were full of sparkle.</p>

<p>“Oh, girls,” she cried. “I had the most wonderful
dream last night. What do you think?
It was a most adorable dream. I dreamed that
I was engaged to the nicest man and—”</p>

<p>“What! Again?” shouted the Overlanders.</p>

<p>“Yes. Why not? He was a cowboy, and I
dreamed that he had just shot a man who made
eyes at me. Wasn’t that a perfectly adorable
thing for him to do?”</p>

<p>“Which man to do what?” questioned Stacy.</p>

<p>“For my fiancé to shoot the other fellow, of
course. I just loved him for that.”</p>

<p>“Emma, we will have you in a strait-jacket
yet,” retorted Grace laughingly. “How many
does this one make?”</p>

<p>“Two real ones and a spiritual one. You know
the one last night wasn’t a real fiancé—”</p>

<p>“Just an imponderable quantity or quality,”
suggested Stacy Brown, which brought a laugh
from the Overlanders, and made Hippy grin despite
the fact that it hurt him to twist his
swollen face.</p>

<p>Hippy, while feeling much improved, was sore
and weak, and when Joe Bindloss rode up, as the
Overlanders were eating breakfast, he said he
had arranged to have them move their camp up
near the ranch-house, as it would be some time
before Lieutenant Wingate would again be able
to ride.</p>

<p>“He can stay at my house and I’ll take all
the care of him that he needs. You folks can
make trips out and stay as long as you want to.
What about it?”</p>

<p>The Overlanders agreed, and the rancher said
the buckboard would be down later in the morning
to fetch the wounded man. Bindloss sat down
and ate breakfast with his new friends, and they
had just finished the meal when Sam Conifer
called to them that the cowboys were coming
back, one of them leading an extra mustang.</p>

<p>Glasses were soon leveled at the approaching
dust cloud which Sam had identified as belonging
to the Circle O bunch. As the riders rode out of
the cloud Grace uttered a cry of delight.</p>

<p>“It is Ginger! They have found Ginger!
Oh, I’m so glad.”</p>

<p>“Only Ginger! Fiddlesticks!” growled Stacy
in disgust. “Somebody will have to buy me a
new pony. I’m not going to walk. You take my
word for that.”</p>

<p>“Ginger!” cried Grace as the punchers rode
in, dust-covered, smiling, happy in being able to
do something for one of the Overland girls.</p>

<p>The little pony trotted to her, showing every
evidence of being glad to be back with his mistress,
and Grace petted and fed the scrubby-looking
mustang until Sam took the animal away and
tethered him.</p>

<p>“We found him grazin’ ’bout fifteen mile down
the valley,” explained Pete.</p>

<p>“What about the men who stole him?”
demanded Bindloss.</p>

<p>“We didn’t find ’em,” said Pete. “Thar was
three dead mustangs out thar, though, but saddles
and bridles had been taken off, leavin’ nothin’ to
identify the outfit by.”</p>

<p>“See any blood?” questioned Sam Conifer.</p>

<p>“Wal, I reckon as thar was some,” answered
Pete, with a grin. “This is the bunch thet got
yer mustangs, folks. No doubt ’bout thet. Boss,
what do ye reckon on our doin’ next?”</p>

<p>“Help these folks move up to the ranch-house.”</p>

<p>“Thank you, but we can attend to that. We
have our mules and one pony with which to operate,”
spoke up Tom Gray. “If you will arrange
to get Lieutenant Wingate up, as you have suggested,
we shall be all set.”</p>

<p>Nevada was sent to the ranch to fetch the
buckboard and returned with it in about an
hour. In the meantime the cowpunchers were
interested witnesses to the breaking of camp, in
which all the Overlanders except Hippy participated,
and in a short time packs were rolled and
Jim-Sam were lashing them to the mules and to
Ginger.</p>

<p>“I reckon these heah folks ain’t no tenderfeet,”
observed Sierra, as the cowboys rode away.</p>

<p>“Have ye jest found thet out?” drawled Two-gun
Pete. “If they kin all fit like the Dude
kin, the rustlers better hike fer the mountains an’
stay thar.”</p>

<p>Nora, riding with Hippy, swung a hand to the
men as the buckboard passed them on the way
to the Circle O ranch, and by the time the rest of
the party reached there Hippy was taking what
ease he could get on a cot on the front porch of the
ranch-house.</p>

<p>The Overland Riders pitched their camp on a
little rise of ground a short distance to the rear
of the ranch buildings, and the cowpunchers observed
this further operation with interest.</p>

<p>“Good job,” approved Idaho.</p>

<p>“Thank you,” smiled Grace. “We hope you
boys will come around whenever you can. You
all have been mighty kind to us and we appreciate
it.”</p>

<p>“Where did you folks larn to do things like
you do?” asked Nevada.</p>

<p>“Mostly from our western experiences. Of
course we learned a few things in the war.”</p>

<p>“The war? Was you thar?” laughed Sierra.</p>

<p>“Yes. I drove an ambulance. The other
young women were in the service as hospital
workers, and the like. My husband, Tom Gray,
was a Captain of Engineers, and Lieutenant Wingate
was a flier—a fighting pilot,” Grace informed
them.</p>

<p>“Gee whiz! Ain’t thet the limit?” wondered
Idaho.</p>

<p>“The next question is, what are we going to do
for horses? Do any of you boys know where we
can buy or rent some?”</p>

<p>“Mebby the Old Man might sell ye what ye
need,” suggested Sallie, who was in charge of the
corral for Bindloss. “I’ll arsk him.”</p>

<p>Grace thanked him, but said Tom Gray would
take the matter up with the rancher. Later in
the morning Tom informed her that he had already
done so, and that arrangements had been
made to rent such ponies as they needed. Bindloss,
he said, did not want to take money from
them, but that the Overlander had insisted on his
doing so. The arrangement, Tom said, was that
they were to pay a rental of two dollars a week
for each pony, and in the event of any of the
animals being lost or injured, the Overland Riders
were to settle for the ponies at the rate of twenty-five
dollars a head.</p>

<p>This was satisfactory to all hands, and on the
following day they were to select their mounts.</p>

<p>That noon they took their luncheon with the
rancher and his men in the bunk-house, by special
invitation. After dinner Nora sang a song,
Emma Dean recited a pathetic little selection to
which she gave the title of “The Cowboy’s Love,”
but which, instead of being about a cowboy, was
the story of a child lost on the desert, and adopted
by a mother wolf that had lost its own offspring.</p>

<p>The Overlanders were of the opinion that
Emma made up the story, but at any rate it made
a hit and moved some of the cowpunchers to tears,
for cowpunchers, like sailors, are sentimental
under their rough exteriors. Emma’s eyes were
twinkling mischievously when she finished and
observed the effect of her story.</p>

<p>The cowmen wiped their eyes, then gave her a
cowboy yell. Stacy Brown rose and bowed low
in acknowledgment, which brought a loud guffaw.
The dance that had been so rudely interrupted on
a previous occasion was then resumed, and thirty
minutes later the gathering broke up, every cowboy
face wearing a broad grin. The Overlanders
surely had brought sunshine to the Circle O
ranch.</p>

<p>As all hands strolled out into the open, Emma
walking at the side of Two-gun Pete, gazing up
soulfully into his embarrassed face, Elfreda Briggs
pointed to a cloud of dust far down the valley,
a cloud that was rolling rapidly towards them.</p>

<p>“That looks like a young tornado,” observed
Stacy.</p>

<p>“I reckon thet’s it, and on a hoss, too,” said
Idaho.</p>

<p>“On a horse?” wondered Emma.</p>

<p>“Yes. You’ll see when it gits heah. Wait!”
chuckled Idaho.</p>

<p>The Overland party now watched the cloud
with new interest, and the cowboys laughed as
they observed the puzzled expression on the faces
of their guests.</p>

<p>“It is someone on a horse. You can’t fool me,”
cried Emma.</p>

<p>“Yes, and it is a girl, too,” added Elfreda.</p>

<p>The rider came on like an incipient whirlwind,
her mustang on a run. She shot by the spectators
and went on for some distance, then, circling
out into the valley, came dashing up to them and
flung herself from the saddle.</p>

<p>The newcomer gazed from one to another of the
Overland Riders, while the cowpunchers chuckled
to themselves. They knew the girl and looked
for something interesting to follow. It did.</p>

<p>“I’m Judy! Who be you?” she demanded.</p>

<p>“We are the Overland Riders,” answered Stacy
Brown pompously.</p>

<p>Judy eyed the fat boy frowningly, then once
more ran her gaze over the rest of the party.</p>

<p>“My gosh! You are a sweet bunch of dudes,
ain’t you? Here you, Idaho Jones, take my
cayuse,” she demanded, tossing the bridle-rein to
the grinning cowboy.</p>

<p>Judy Hornby, in introducing herself to the newcomers
in the Coso Valley, had done so in
characteristic fashion.</p>
</div>

<h2 id='chIX' title='IX: JUDY SPEAKS OUT'>
<span>CHAPTER IX</span><br />
<span>JUDY SPEAKS OUT</span>
</h2>

<p>“Hello, little gal!” cried Bindloss,
coming forward with extended hand
and smiling face.</p>

<p>“Hello! Why don’t you introduce me to your
friends?”</p>

<p>“Why, Judy, don’t you know them?”</p>

<p>“No, but I’m goin’ to in ’bout a minute,”
answered Judy, who shook hands and commented
on each member of the Overland party as Joe
Bindloss introduced her. “Some knock-down,
ain’t it?” grinned Judy after the introductions
had been finished. “My Pap says you folks ain’t
no great scratch an’ that you ain’t here for no
good. Pap says that Old Joe Bindloss better
build a corral ’bout his cattle or he’ll lose ’em with
all these new folks roamin’ ’round in the hills.
Be you a fine lady, or ain’t you?” demanded the
mountain girl, fixing her eyes on Elfreda Briggs.
J. Elfreda flushed under the scrutiny.</p>

<p>“No. I am just a plain, ordinary woman, a
bachelor girl and—”</p>

<p>“In other words, an old maid, Miss Hornby,”
Emma Dean explained.</p>

<p>“Cut the ‘Miss.’ My name’s Judy. What’s
your handle?”</p>

<p>“Emma.”</p>

<p>“All right, Emma. Now the rest of you give
me your handles, then we’ll be down to cases,”
whereupon the Overlanders dutifully gave her
their given names. “My gosh! What a lot of
highfalutin’ names. I should think they would
keep you folks awake nights.”</p>

<p>The Overlanders laughed heartily and Judy
joined in the laugh, though with little idea what
she was laughing at. The mountain girl had, in
her lifetime, seen but few persons who did not
belong to desert or mountain, and these bright-eyed
girls were a revelation to her, because, as she
expressed it, “most all that kind is stuck up.”</p>

<p>If Judy was interested in her new acquaintances,
they surely were even more attracted to
her. She was a splendid type, her dark, handsome
face unspoiled by the strenuous outdoor life
she led, and her figure possessing lines that would
have been the envy of any woman. Judy was
only nineteen, so she said, but she looked more.
That she could ride, the Overlanders had the evidence
of their own eyes, and that she could shoot,
was to be inferred from the business-like looking
revolver that swung at her hip.</p>

<p>“Not all are ‘stuck up,’” differed Grace laughingly.
“We are not. If we were we probably
should not be here, roughing it, when we might be
at home taking our ease and getting fat.”</p>

<p>“Judy, you mustn’t take too seriously what
Grace says. Remember, she and Nora are here
with their husbands, both old married women,
here because their husbands want to live part of
the year in the open. That’s the way women do
when they love their husbands,” volunteered
Elfreda.</p>

<p>“A-huh! What are you doin’ here, then?”</p>

<p>“Because I love the open and love my friends
who also enjoy it.”</p>

<p>“What’s love?” flung back the mountain girl.</p>

<p>“Why—I—I—Perhaps you had better ask
Emma. Old maids are not supposed to be authorities
on that subject,” answered Miss Briggs,
her color rising.</p>

<p>“Love? Why, Judy, love is the most wonderful
thing in the world,” cried Emma dramatically,
as Judy turned to her inquiringly. Emma’s
eyes were rolling and she registered extreme emotion,
greatly to the amusement of her companions.</p>

<p>“My gosh! Ain’t goin’ to have a fit, be ye?”
exclaimed Judy, whereat the Overland Riders
shouted.</p>

<p>“Have you ever been in love?” interjected
Nora.</p>

<p>“I don’t know, Nora. Once I seen a fellow in
a play in a tent over at Carrago, and he was some
man, believe me. I jest sat there and looked at
him and my heart got so wiggly that I couldn’t
do nothin’ with it at all. But thet wan’t nothin’
to what happened later in the day when I met him
on the street. He seen me lookin’ at him an’
smiled an’ bobbed his hat to me. My gosh! I
near fainted. I sure thought I was goin’ to die
right there. Never had no such feelin’ in all my
life.”</p>

<p>“Yes?” urged the girls, doing their best to keep
from laughing.</p>

<p>“Did you get acquainted with him?” asked
Grace.</p>

<p>“No. I didn’t dast. My Pap was with me,
but I went home and cried. Can you beat it?”</p>

<p>“Oh, my dear, you <i>were</i> in love. You surely
<i>were</i>,” cried Emma.</p>

<p>“Was I?” wondered the mountain girl. “Was
you ever that way, Emma?”</p>

<p>“Ever? Oh, help!” murmured Miss Briggs.
“Judy, she is even making love to these fine cowboys.
Doesn’t that make you jealous?”</p>

<p>“Jealous? Of them rough-necks? Wal, I
reckon not. I don’t reckon on that kind of critter.
I want a real man, I want to fly, to see what’s on
t’other side of them mountain ranges. I want to
be a real lady an’ know ’bout things. My gosh,
how I want to be like that! It’s right in here!”
cried Judy, clapping a hand over her heart. “I
want to so much that it aches, it hurts like as if a
rattler had given me a jab there. I tried poulticin’
but it wan’t no good. Pap said it was what
I needed, but it wan’t, and here I am. What do
you reckon I ought to do?” finished Judy, passing
a quick hand over her eyes.</p>

<p>The Overlanders did not laugh. There was a
tragic note in the voice of the mountain girl that
stirred their sympathies and moved them. Grace
slipped an arm about her.</p>

<p>“Judy, I wish you might come with us while
we are riding the ranges. Perhaps we might teach
you things that would make you more contented
with your life,” said Grace, her voice full of
sympathy. “Would you like to do that?”</p>

<p>“Like it? I’d be so dum tickled that I couldn’t
hold myself.”</p>

<p>“Then why not come?” urged Nora.</p>

<p>“I don’t dast. Pap would take it out of me
right smart.”</p>

<p>“You don’t mean he would punish you—that
he would lay hands on you?” begged Elfreda.</p>

<p>“Him wallop me? Wal, I reckon not! I ain’t
packin’ no gun for nothin’.”</p>

<p>“Judy!” cried Nora. “You mustn’t say such
things. Why not let us ask your father to let
you go with us?”</p>

<p>“Ask <i>him</i>?” Judy shook her head with emphasis.
“You folks keep away from Pap if you
know what’s good for you. Pap’s got a grouch
on most of the time, and he ain’t particular ’bout
who knows it. You keep away from Pap, ’cause
he don’t set much store by this here outfit. He
reckons as you ain’t got no business here, an’ if
you come foolin’ round he’ll chase you out.
Would you go?” she demanded abruptly.</p>

<p>“It has been tried on us on other occasions,
but up to the present time we have never gone
until we were quite ready to do so,” answered
Miss Briggs.</p>

<p>“I wondered what you’d do, when I dreamed
somethin’ ’bout you last night—”</p>

<p>“Dreamed? Do you dream, Judy?” cried
Emma, her face full of sudden interest.</p>

<p>“I reckon I do. I dreamed ’bout that actor
feller for a month.”</p>

<p>“Oh, isn’t that adorable!” bubbled Emma.
“The imponderable quality is working in you.
Listen, dear. When you have another dream, you
come straight to me and I’ll make a psychoanalysis
of it and tell you what it means.”</p>

<p>“My gosh! If I could talk like that I’d be
a real lady, wouldn’t I? Where you goin’ from
here?”</p>

<p>“We don’t know. All depends upon how my
husband gets along with his wounds. He was
shot in a fight with the men who, we believe,
stole our ponies, but we hope that he will be able
to ride in a short time,” answered Nora.</p>

<p>“Ain’t that too bad? Gosh! If a fellow hurt
my man I reckon I’d do some shootin’ for myself,”
observed Judy. “Who do you think rustled
them ponies?”</p>

<p>Tom Gray said they did not know, but that
they proposed to find out, and asked her if she
or her father had any suspicion as to who the
rustlers were. Judy shook her head.</p>

<p>“I don’t know nothin’. That’s what I’ve been
trying to tell you. Say, Emma, what’s that word
you got off jest now?”</p>

<p>“Imponderable,” intoned Stacy gloomily.</p>

<p>“I didn’t ask you, Mr. Fatty. Write it down,
Emma, and I’ll try it on Pap. I’ll bet there’ll be
some fun. Wal, I reckon I’ll be hittin’ the trail
for home. So long, Tom. Hippy, I hopes your
laig gets better right smart,” she called to the
Overlander on the porch. “’Bye, girls.”</p>

<p>“Come again soon, and as often as you can,”
urged Grace.</p>

<p>“Sure I will. Mebby I can’t get back today,
but I’ll try. Say, Emma, I’m goin’ to practice
that word on Butte. That’s my mustang. If he
stands for it I reckon Pap can,” finished Judy,
starting slowly towards her pony, arms linked
with Grace and Elfreda. “Butte’s got a temper
somethin’ like Pap’s. I reckon he got it from
Pap, too. Let’s see. What’s that word? Im—impond’ble.
All right. Jest watch me.”</p>

<p>Judy swung lightly into her saddle.</p>

<p>“G’wan, you impond’ble, dad-busted cayuse,”
she shouted, touching the animal lightly with a
spur.</p>

<p>Butte responded instantly. Uttering a grunt,
both hind heels went into the air before Judy
had succeeded in getting her feet into the stirrups.</p>

<p>The mountain girl made a quick reach for the
swinging stirrups and missed, whereupon the mustang
leaped clear of the ground, coming down
stiffly on all four feet, head down with hind
quarters shooting into the air. Judy was catapulted
over his head and landed on her back with
a whack that should have knocked all the breath
out of her.</p>

<p>Tom Gray made a quick spring for the pony’s
head and grabbed the bridle. The pony fought
him, but a firm grip on the animal’s nose shut
off his breathing and subdued him in a moment.</p>

<p>The girls ran to Judy just as she sat up. Judy
was a little dazed, but she grinned.</p>

<p>“Oh, you poor girl! You’re hurt,” cried Nora.</p>

<p>“Mebby I be, but I reckon the ground is hurt
worse. Anyhow what happened to me an’ the
ground ain’t a flea-bite to what’s goin’ to happen
to Butte afore we gets home. Say, Emma! I
don’t reckon as I’ll say that word to Pap all of a
sudden. I’m too dad-busted sore now to have
another fight on my hands tonight, and I’ll be
sorer by the time I gets home. I’m goin’ to ride
him this time.”</p>

<p>Judy again flung herself into the saddle, and
this time both feet caught the stirrups. The
mustang instantly threw himself into another
buck. The spur dug into him harder and harder
and Judy’s whip came down on his flank again and
again. A leap carried them clear of the Overland
party, and for the next few moments they were
treated to the most spirited exhibition of horsemanship
that they had ever seen. Old Bindloss
was shaking with laughter, and the cowpunchers
were howling with delight and firing their six-shooters
into the air.</p>

<p>“She’s got him!” cried Emma. “Oh, I wish
I could ride like that. There she comes!”</p>

<p>Judy, who was by now a full quarter of a mile
out in the valley, had whirled and was driving
straight at them. On she came, the pony’s efforts
to unseat its rider growing less and less, as its
speed increased.</p>

<p>“Whoo—pe-e-e-e!” yelled Judy in her shrill,
high-pitched voice as she reached the Overlanders,
and turning, tore off down the valley where she
was soon lost to sight in a cloud of dust.</p>
</div>

<div class='chapter'>
<h2 id='chX' title='X: THE ROUND-UP'>
<span>CHAPTER X</span><br />
<span>THE ROUND-UP</span>
</h2>

<p>Judy Hornby did not return to the Circle
O ranch that day nor the next, and when
she did she was not nearly so talkative as
before. The girl, however, listened eagerly to all
that her new-found friends had to say to her, and
what they said was intended to be helpful to
this unusual young woman who had known little
companionship of her own sex.</p>

<p>After a time her tongue loosened a little and
she told them that “Pap” had forbidden her to
visit them unless he told her to go. Judy declared
that she didn’t give a rap whether he liked
it or not, and that she was going to ride over to
the Circle O ranch whenever she felt like it.</p>

<p>“He don’t dast do nothing to me anyway. I
reckon it’s because I tried that ‘impond’able’
thing on him. When he asked me where I got it
an’ I told him over here, you ought to seen him
git mad. Pap sure was a scream. Lemme look
at your hair,” she added abruptly, addressing Miss
Briggs, who nodded good-naturedly.</p>

<p>“Gosh! Ain’t that fine? But for the love of
Mike, how do you do it?”</p>

<p>“I will do yours if you wish,” offered Elfreda.</p>

<p>“Would you?”</p>

<p>“Of course,” answered J. Elfreda. “Sit down
and I will see what I can do with it. You have
beautiful hair, and I am not eager to see you
wear it any other way than you do now—down
your back.”</p>

<p>Greatly to the amusement of her companions,
Miss Briggs performed an elaborate piece of hair-dressing,
building up a wonderful tower of shining
brown on the mountain girl’s head. Then a
mirror was brought and Judy was permitted to
look at the result, the Overlanders awaiting the
verdict in silent expectancy.</p>

<p>Judy gazed into the mirror for some moments
before looking up.</p>

<p>“Gosh-a’mighty, I’m a lady now for sure, ain’t
I?” she breathed, heaving a deep sigh.</p>

<p>After a time the Overland girls sought to explain
to her that it was not the dress she wore nor
the way she wore her hair, but her breeding, that
made the lady. Judy listened attentively to the
brief lecture read to her by Grace and Elfreda,
then started for home, this time at a slow jog.
Judy was in a thoughtful mood.</p>

<p>For the next week she was a daily visitor at the
Circle O ranch. Hippy Wingate was again on his
feet, but still wearing a bandage on his head and
walking with a cane. His companions were in no
haste to leave him; in fact they had been waiting
for his recovery quite willingly because they had
been urged by Bindloss to stay for the round-up
that was now close at hand, when the cattle
would be rounded up into herds and the fat ones
cut out, branded again and driven to a shipping
point for market. Bindloss promised his guests
a lively time. The cowpunchers, too, were looking
forward to the occasion with more than their
ordinary interest, for in it they saw an opportunity
to show their horsemanship and skill to the Overland
girls.</p>

<p>Judy Hornby was invited to accompany the
party to the round-up, but for some reason she
refused, and went away that day with her face
dark and resentful. The Overlanders were at a
loss to account for the sudden change in her.</p>

<p>The day of the big round-up arrived, and the
ranch presented a scene of activity long before
daylight that morning. There was much equipment
to be shipped down the valley, for the first
herd to be rounded up were grazing more than
twenty miles away, not very far from Judy’s log-cabin
home, where her father had quite a herd of
cattle of his own, though small compared with the
Bindloss herds. His brand was the “Double Q”
while Bindloss’s was the “Circle O.”</p>

<p>Lieutenant Wingate, not feeling able to take
the long ride, decided to remain at the ranch-house
until one of the herds near by was rounded
up. He could watch the round-up, then easily
get back to the ranch-house should he find it
necessary to do so. There being no reason for
Jim-Sam’s remaining at the ranch, Bindloss accepted
their offer to assist in the round-up.</p>

<p>“I am going to help, too,” promised Emma, as
they were eating breakfast in camp next morning
with Bindloss as their guest.</p>

<p>“No, you ain’t,” replied the rancher. “You
keep out of it and stay where you’re safe. There’s
some wild ones in the bunch we are going after
today.”</p>

<p>Tom Gray was accepted as a novice, and a
pony that knew the ropes was assigned to him for
the work. Bindloss told him that so long as he
gave the animal its head he would be reasonably
safe.</p>

<p>The Overlanders got a later start than the
others, but managed to get away shortly after
daybreak. It was a wonderful ride through the
fragrant morning air, one that every member of
the party thoroughly enjoyed. Hippy in the
meantime was having a glorious morning, too—snoring
in the ranch-house, where he proposed to
remain all day and have “peace and quiet,” as
he expressed it.</p>

<p>As they neared the scene of the round-up, near
mid-forenoon, the Overlanders rode up the first
bluff of the foothills, as they had been directed to
do, and then followed along parallel with the
valley. As they drew near they suddenly found
themselves gazing down upon the scene that they
had come so far to see—a western round-up.</p>

<p>A great herd—thousands of them, it seemed—were
milling about on the plain below them,
making the dust fly in suffocating clouds, while
wilder ones of the herd were galloping for the
foothills. Calves were running about bawling for
their mothers, and frantic cows were splitting the
herd in search of them. Above the din rose
shrill and clear the calls of the cowpunchers, calls
that were familiar, especially to the steers, who
seemed to know the meaning of them even if they
did do exactly the opposite to what was expected
of them.</p>

<p>Up and down the rolling foothills raced the
long-horns, with ponies ridden by yelling, shouting,
dare-devil riders, in pursuit. Here and there
a lasso wriggled through the air, spun by an irate
cowboy, and a big steer went down on his nose.</p>

<p>A bunch of wild steers raced past the Overlanders,
and Stacy, suddenly deciding that it was
his duty to drive them back, galloped after them.</p>

<p>The fat boy soon found himself in the midst of
a charging, bellowing mass of wild steers whose
long horns and threatening jabs at his mustang,
made him wish that he had kept out of it. He
was in a more perilous position than he realized.
The girls were shouting for him to come back,
but in the uproar Stacy did not hear them, nor
could he have obeyed had he heard.</p>

<p>Two-gun Pete was the first to discover the boy’s
predicament. He came flashing up the grade,
past the girls, but without looking at them, and
rode on until he had reached the herd. There
he began uttering shrill yells that were heard
above the uproar. Pete, at the risk of his pony’s
life, if not his own, dodged in and out until he
got to the side of the fat boy.</p>

<p>“Hot-foot it out of this, you tenderfoot!” he
roared.</p>

<p>“All right. Show me the way, you cowpuncher!”
flung back Stacy.</p>

<p>“Follow me, but not too close.” Pete, exerting
mighty efforts, soon split the herd apart, and
into the opening thus made, Stacy rode without
further urging, and in a few moments he was clear
of the herd. “Now git back with ye and stay
back!”</p>

<p>Now that he was up there, Pete decided to head
off the wild bunch. He rode his sweating mustang
until it seemed as if he would ride the little
animal off its feet, and little by little he bunched
the unruly steers and started them towards the
valley, when they suddenly headed straight for
the position occupied by the Overlanders.</p>

<p>“They’ll run us down!” cried Nora.</p>

<p>“No! We can get away if they get too close.
Ride for them and yell like all possessed. Try
to turn them to their left,” urged Grace.</p>

<p>The Overland girls, fired with the same spirit
that was urging the cowpunchers in their work,
started forward at a gallop, waving their sombreros
and uttering such screeches as probably
not only astounded, but frightened the outlaw
steers. The cattle, however, held to their course
just the same. Two-gun Pete saw and understood
what the girls were trying to do. He also
understood full well the risk they were taking.
Pete pealed out a shrill, far-reaching warning, but
they did not hear.</p>

<p>“Yell, you Overlanders!” screamed Elfreda
Briggs, and, taking her own advice, she uttered
yell after yell, that Two-gun Pete later declared
on his honor as a cowpuncher frightened one
tough old maverick to death. At least the animal
was found dead at about that point, later on in
the day.</p>

<p>J. Elfreda evidently turned the tide, for a
leader swerved, and the herd followed him and
went plunging down the slope.</p>

<p>“Hot stuff, but don’t ye do it again!” shouted
the cowboy as he followed the herd down the
foothill and out into the valley, where other cowpunchers
came to his assistance and rounded it up.</p>

<p>The girls, now that the excitement was ended,
suddenly felt weak in the knees. They realized
that they had taken a desperate chance, and that
they had not been unhorsed, and perhaps gored to
death, was due to great good luck, and to the
far-reaching power of the dignified Elfreda Briggs’
voice, rather than to any skill on their part.</p>

<p>“That was a fool thing to do,” observed Stacy,
who now came trotting up to them.</p>

<p>“Why, you unappreciative creature!” rebuked
Emma. “Don’t you know that we were trying
to save your life?”</p>

<p>“Save nothing!” growled Stacy.</p>

<p>“Thank you,” bowed Emma. “I could not
have said it better myself,” whereupon the other
girls laughed merrily, and Stacy drew off by himself
where he sat sullenly observing the work
going on below him.</p>

<p>All day the milling about, the cutting-out, the
yells and the bellows, with here and there a sharp
encounter between cowboy and an ugly steer, continued
without a let-up. No one thought of
eating. There was too much work to be done,
and even the Overlanders forgot their noon
luncheon which they had brought with them.</p>

<p>At twilight the cowmen were still busy, but
by this time they had several hundred animals
in the big corral, and in another a bunch of
stock for branding, while out on the range as
many more animals were stirring about restlessly.
Campfires began to spring up here and there,
over which tired riders cooked their slender
suppers and rested before taking up the work of
the night. This work included branding and
keeping rounded-up the stock left out on the
range. Bindloss joined the Overlanders at their
coffee and bacon. He was covered with dust and
his voice was hoarse from yelling at cattle and
at his riders.</p>

<p>“How long is this thing going to continue?”
questioned Stacy Brown.</p>

<p>“All night, young feller. Of course things will
quiet down ’long ’bout midnight. We’ve got
to get some rest, you know.”</p>

<p>Grace said she thought that they should be
starting back towards camp after supper, but
Bindloss shook his head.</p>

<p>“Some of the men will be going in later in the
evening. I’d rather have you folks wait and ride
in with them,” he said, but without giving any
reason for the request. “You can ride ’bout after
supper, but keep away from milling bunches, and
see the sights. You’ll be interested in the branding,
if you’ve never seen it done.”</p>

<p>Soon after supper the girls of the party, accompanied
by Stacy, rode down the valley. There
they scattered somewhat, Emma first having discovered
Two-gun Pete and stopping to talk with
him. Stacy rode on, saying that he wished to
see the rest of the show.</p>

<p>Pete told Emma that he did not like the way
the cattle had been acting that day. He averred
that something had been stirring them up of late,
but reckoned it must be a mountain lion that had
been trying to get the calves. Whether or not the
beast had succeeded he said he did not know,
for no one knew how many calves there were in
any of the herds.</p>

<p>Two-gun Pete had work to do, so Emma rode
on and joined her companions whom she found
chatting with the owner of the ranch, who sat
his pony surveying the activity that was everywhere.
They wondered how he could make anything
out of all the confusion in the darkness,
which the many little fires merely accentuated.
Joe Bindloss, however, knew exactly what was
going on at all points of the round-up.</p>

<p>Idaho Jones interrupted the conversation when
he came galloping up to the party.</p>

<p>“Hey, Boss!” he called. “I been lookin’ all
over fer ye.” The voice of the cowpuncher held
an urgent note that each member of the party
before him felt.</p>

<p>“Eh? What’s wrong?” demanded Bindloss
sharply.</p>

<p>“Pop Skinner jest rode in, an’ he’s lookin’ fer
ye hot-foot. He says as he reckons thar’s trouble
up in the valley.”</p>

<p>“What about?”</p>

<p>“He didn’t wait to tell me.”</p>

<p>“Find him—find him and fetch him here
almighty quick! Hump yourself!” commanded
Bindloss.</p>

<p>“Co—o-o-o-o! Pop, heah,” yelled Idaho, his
quick eye discovering the man for whom he was
looking, and out of the darkness shot a gray mustang
bearing down on them. “Thar he is now.”</p>

<p>“What’s wrong?” shouted Bindloss.</p>

<p>“I don’t reckon as I know, Boss, but as I was
comin’ down to jine the outfit heah, I runned
across Sallie guardin’ the number six herd. He
said as he’d seen a bunch of riders come out of
the foothills, ’bout four mile above heah an’ head
off in the direction of the ranch an’ he thought
ye better know ’bout it. As I was comin’ down
anyway, I made a hustle. ’Bout half way down
I heard rifle shots up-valley. Thet’s all I knows
’bout it, but I reckoned you ought to know.”</p>

<p>“Get Pete and all the other fellers you can
skin in a hurry and light out for the ranch.
There’s trouble, and I’ve felt it somehow all
day!”</p>

<p>While Bindloss was giving his orders another
cowpuncher rode in on a pony that was dripping
lather. He, too, was from somewhere up the Coso
Valley and he was excited.</p>

<p>“They’ve attacked the ranch, Boss!” he fairly
flung at Bindloss.</p>

<p>“Who’s attacked it?” roared the rancher.</p>

<p>“Don’t know nothin’ ’bout thet, but I seen an’
heard the firin’ and thar’s the old Harry to pay
up thar.”</p>

<p>Idaho had already ridden away to gather a
bunch of his fellows for the ride back to the ranch,
and while this was being done Bindloss eagerly
questioned the two men who had brought him evil
tidings. Perhaps Bindloss had an idea as to who
the men from the mountain were, but if so he
did not inform the disturbed Overlanders. They
were thinking of Hippy up there alone in the
ranch-house, himself suffering from wounds and
perhaps helpless in the hands of a band of mountain
ruffians.</p>

<p>“We must go!” cried Nora.</p>

<p>“Yes, we will go,” answered Grace. “I wish
I could find Tom.”</p>

<p>“They’ll get him,” answered Bindloss. “You’ll
have to ride some if you keep up with the cowpunchers,
and this ain’t no pleasure trip neither.
Here they come!”</p>

<p>Pete was leading the party of rough-riders that
came racing towards him, and with them was Tom
Gray. His companions of the Overland party
hardly recognized him, for his clothes were covered
with dust and his face was streaked where the
perspiration had trickled through the grime.</p>

<p>“Orders, Boss?” called Pete.</p>

<p>“Ride! Ride the cayuses to death, but get
there, that’s all. Go!”</p>

<p>The cowboys pulled their mustangs and fairly
lifted them, rearing and wheeling, and were off
like projectiles, fierce fires burning in every cowboy
heart, and the lust for battle and revenge
taking full possession of them.</p>

<p>The Overland Riders were not many seconds
behind them in starting, nor did they have to urge
their mustangs, who were as eager as they to keep
up with the reckless riders ahead, riders that were
using spur and voice in the wild night ride up the
Coso Valley.</p>

<span>CHAPTER XI</span><br />
<span>HIPPY DEFENDS THE RANCH</span>
</h2>

<p>Lieutenant Wingate after a refreshing
afternoon’s sleep had remained
up long enough to brew tea and fry bacon
and eggs for himself. It was dusk when he
finished his supper.</p>

<p>“I ought to wash the dishes, I suppose, but
I think I’ll let the girls do that. There is some
satisfaction in being a convalescent,” he decided,
grinning at his own humor. “Queer thing about
convalescence—when you get through with your
sleep you are ready for another. Ho, hum!”</p>

<p>Hippy, with the aid of a cane, hobbled out to
the porch that fronted the valley and sat down on
his cot, then lay back breathing in the soft breezes
from mountain and plain.</p>

<p>“This is the life,” he muttered, sinking into a
half doze.</p>

<p>All at once the Overland Rider pulled himself
into keen wakefulness. He was positive that he
heard horses approaching, but they seemed to be
a long way off. His first thought was that either
the Overlanders or some of the cowboys were on
their way home, but with the caution born of
experience, he decided to lie quietly and wait.</p>

<p>The hoof-beats ceased, so far as he was able
to hear, and silence settled over the valley, broken
now and then by the howl of a hungry coyote.
Somehow this sudden silence got on the nerves
of Lieutenant Hippy Wingate, and getting up he
hobbled into the ranch-house and strapped on his
revolver holster. Bethinking himself of Bindloss’s
rifle he got that, examined the chambers
and, as he expected, found it fully loaded.</p>

<p>“Now we are all set,” he muttered. He had
reached the ranch-house door when he halted
sharply and gazed into the night over which the
stars shed a faint light, making objects within
the range of his vision stand out in unreal and
fantastic shapes. Hippy, however, did see something
moving, something that was quite real.
This something was a man, and as he gazed other
figures were discovered.</p>

<p>“I wonder if that’s some of the boys?” he
muttered. Upon second thought he decided that
the cowpunchers would not be moving about so
quietly. Three appeared to have come from the
direction of the Overland camp at the rear of the
ranch-house, and Hippy then knew that all was
not well at the Circle O ranch. He stepped back,
softly closed and bolted the door, and took his
place at a window that had been pulled down
from the top. From that vantage point he
watched with straining eyes.</p>

<p>The men appeared to be investigating, undoubtedly
for the purpose of learning whether or not
there were anyone about the place. One finally
turned his attention to the ranch-house, first
cautiously trying the door, then peering in through
the window. Hippy had stepped aside as the
man approached him, and a few seconds later he
saw a face pressed against the pane.</p>

<p>After a moment of peering, the fellow carefully
raised both windows from the bottom and thrust
his head in.</p>

<p>Hippy pressed his body against the wall and
grasped his revolver by the barrel. The fellow’s
shoulders were thrust in and the watcher saw that
he was about to climb in.</p>

<p>Lieutenant Hippy Wingate took instant advantage
of the opportunity and brought the butt
of his revolver down with full force on the intruder’s
head. The whack was so loud that the
Overlander thought the others must hear, and,
without an instant’s hesitation, he grabbed and
dragged the unconscious man into the room.</p>

<p>“I hope I haven’t killed the ruffian!” A hand
placed over the man’s heart told Hippy that he
had not. Hippy, knowing that there was a lasso
hanging in Bindloss’s room, in fact that there
were several there, hobbled in, and fetching the
rope, hog-tied the man, after which he put a
handkerchief gag in the fellow’s mouth.</p>

<p>“Good! This is like taking candy from babies,”
he chuckled, going over to the window and replacing
it as it was before. This enabled him to
stand up and look out, and also gave him free
range in case he found it necessary to use his
weapons. Bethinking himself of other windows,
Hippy made a circuit of the lower floor and closed
and locked them. For a man to get in now would
necessitate breaking a window, which he surely
would hear.</p>

<p>The watcher had no more than returned to his
open window than he suddenly ducked to one
side, for he discovered that a second man was
about to peer in. Unlike the first caller this man
walked away and went around to the rear of the
house, but he was back in a few moments, this
time accompanied by a companion. They were
whispering, and at this instant the man on the
floor gave a kick with his heel that stopped the
whispering instantly.</p>

<p>Lieutenant Wingate went over to the bound
man.</p>

<p>“Do that again and I’ll settle you!” he hissed
with all the savageness that he could put into his
tone. “I mean what I say!”</p>

<p>Returning to the window he stood to one side
watching the two men who were again holding a
whispered conversation, pausing now and then
to listen attentively. After a few moments of this,
one raised the window an inch or so at a time
and looked in. In the darkness they saw nothing.</p>

<p>“I reckon it’s all right. I’ll go in an’ ye foller
me,” said one in a low, guarded tone of voice,
whereupon he began crawling in. As he landed
on his hands on the floor, Lieutenant Wingate
hit him a terrific wallop on the head with the
butt of his revolver, then made a swift pass with
it at the head of the other man whose head was
just inside the window.</p>

<p>It hit the fellow a glancing blow, and jerking
his head from the window he fell over backwards,
then staggering to his feet he ran, uttering a
warning cry.</p>

<p>The time for secrecy, so far as Lieutenant Hippy
Wingate was concerned, had passed. He sent a
bullet from his revolver after the man and then
discovering other prowlers trying to get into the
corral, he snatched up the rifle, and fired at the
ground just behind them.</p>

<p>The prowlers scattered in record time and a
volley of shots pinged into the ranch-house in
reply.</p>

<p>The Overland Rider now hastily turned his
attention to his second victim, and in a few
minutes he had the man bound and dragged to
the other side of the room at a distance from the
first prisoner.</p>

<p>“Confound the ruffians! Why couldn’t they
have come singly?” he growled. “I could have
caught the whole bunch. I reckon maybe there
will be something doing in a few moments.”</p>

<p>There was. A rifle crashed out, then another,
and a snapping fire was directed at the Circle O
ranch-house, with Hippy lying flat on the floor
waiting for the shooting to stop. It soon did,
whereupon the Overlander crept to the window
and peered out. Not a human being was in sight,
but the watcher was too old a hand at campaigning
to believe that the prowlers had gone away.
He reasoned, too, that by making no return of
their fire, they might believe that they had hit
him. As he had surmised would be the case, a
man appeared after a time just beyond the corral.
The fellow darted across and disappeared behind
the stable where saddles and other equipment
were stored.</p>

<p>The man’s next appearance was a few moments
later when he walked to the corral, looked in and
strolled back to the protection of the stable.
Others then appeared, at first exercising the utmost
caution, but little by little showing that they
believed danger to them had passed.</p>

<p>Hippy Wingate chuckled. His ruse had succeeded,
but he knew the end was not yet. At
the same time he was groping for the reason for
the presence of these prowlers. From their
actions he believed that they were trying to steal
the ponies, and a moment later he saw them again
at work trying to break the locked gate of the
corral. They were battering away at it so boldly
that he knew they now feared no interruption.</p>

<p>“I’ve got to take a chance,” muttered the Overland
Rider, “but I’ll shoot low. Perhaps I won’t
hit any of the stock.”</p>

<p>There was no time to lose, for in a few moments
those sledge-hammer blows, that were probably
delivered with a maul or an axe, must produce
results.</p>

<p>Taking as careful aim as he could in the uncertain
light, he pulled the trigger and Old Joe
Bindloss’s rifle roared.</p>

<p>A yell greeted the shot, by which sign Lieutenant
Wingate knew that the bullet had found
a mark. He fired again, but this time there was
no answering yell. Two men grabbed up one of
their number, the party started on a run for the
stable and Hippy deliberately fired right into the
group. One man staggered and fell. He was
quickly dragged away, but not before the Overland
Rider had emptied his rifle at them, though,
so far as he was able to discover, without results.
Accurate shooting was impossible under the conditions.</p>

<p>The rancher’s rifle was now empty, nor did
Lieutenant Wingate know where to find more
ammunition. He possessed his revolver and a
belt of cartridges which would keep him going for
some time, provided he were conservative in their
use, so the rifle was laid aside and the revolver
took its place. A quick examination of the two
captives informed him that both were conscious.</p>

<p>“You fellows! Don’t you make a sound or
I’ll use the business end of my gun on you,” he
warned.</p>

<p>Rifle bullets at this juncture again began ripping
through the side of the house, and while
they were still crunching about the room with a
chilling sound the Overlander, who was on the
floor, heard a powerful blow delivered on the door.
It was followed by other blows. The ruffians were
trying to beat the door down, and already a panel
had been shattered.</p>

<p>Hippy hopped to his feet and placed himself
before the door, feeling reasonably safe there so
long as men were standing in front of it.</p>

<p>Thrusting the muzzle of his weapon close to
the shattered panel he pulled the trigger, and a
howl of rage answered it. This shot had not
missed.</p>

<p>Before giving the attackers a chance to do
further damage Hippy fired the remaining
chambers of his revolver through the door in quick
succession. He did not know whether or not he
had made a hit, but he knew that, for the moment,
he had effectively checked operations out there.</p>

<p>A few seconds were lost in reloading, during
which not a sound reached him from the outside.
Stooping over, he peered through the shattered
panel. As he did so there came a sudden burst
of rifle fire and a dozen bullets ripped through
the door.</p>

<p>Lieutenant Wingate straightened up, staggered,
clapped a hand to his head, half turned and
crashed full length to the floor. As he lay there,
bullets continued to thud through the door and
the siding of the ranch-house, then ceased as suddenly
as they had begun, but Hippy, some
moments since, had ceased to hear or know.</p>
</div>

<h2 id='chXII' title='XII: AT THE LAST MOMENT'>
<span>CHAPTER XII</span><br />
<span>AT THE LAST MOMENT</span>
</h2>

<p>“Smoke him out!” came the sharp
command after the firing had died down.
“That’ll fetch the critter. Then git
him.”</p>

<p>Some dead grass, a handful of chips and a
match did the work, and a flickering blaze was
soon started under one corner of the ranch-house.</p>

<p>“Now the hosses!” commanded the same voice.
“Two of ye git behind the house to watch for
him, the others go fer the mustangs in the corral.”</p>

<p>The men ran to obey the orders of their leader,
when a sudden shout from one of them changed
the plans of the attackers entirely. It was a
shout of warning. Following it the ruffians
plainly heard the sound of hoof-beats approaching—many
of them. They were coming at what
the trained ears of the mountain ruffians told
them was a killing pace.</p>

<p>“Hit the trail!” yelled the leader. “Go south
and scatter! Hit it hard!” came the further
orders.</p>

<p>The ruffians were in their saddles within a
minute thereafter, some of them carrying
wounded companions who had got in the way
of Hippy Wingate’s bullets, and they were around
the corner of the corral in a twinkling. Once in
the shadow of it they faded away into the night,
just as Two-gun Pete and his companions flashed
in with guns ready for instant use.</p>

<p>“Quick! Fire!” shouted Idaho.</p>

<p>“Git water!” yelled Two-gun Pete, leaping
from his mustang.</p>

<p>Old Joe Bindloss came up as the cowpunchers
were dashing water on the flames that were now
licking at the side of the building. He instantly
threw himself from his pony and grabbing a pail
began carrying water and giving orders at the
same time. The blaze was extinguished in a
few minutes. The Overland Riders came up at
this juncture.</p>

<p>“Gosh a-mighty, what’s been going on here?”
bellowed the rancher. “Look at that door!
Clean busted in.”</p>

<p>The boys quickly brought lanterns from the
stable, and by their light discovered the bullet
holes in door and siding. Windows, too, were
shot out at the front of the house.</p>

<p>“Thar’s been a fight heah!” decided Pete.</p>

<p>“Hippy!” wailed Nora, almost collapsing as
her pony stopped.</p>

<p>“We’ll find out about thet, Missie,” answered
Pete. “Hey, Dude! Be you thar?” he shouted.</p>

<p>There was no reply, and the Overlanders ran
for the house, each one fearing the worst.</p>

<p>“Back! I reckon I’ll go in first!” bellowed
Bindloss. “It’s my house, and I reckon it’s up
to me to go in ahead. Boys, get behind me with
the lights so they don’t get in my eyes. You
Overlanders keep out of range in case there should
be some scrapping. No telling what we might
meet in there.” Bindloss with drawn weapon,
Two-gun Pete at his side, strode up and kicked
in the remnants of the front door of his home.
As the door went down both men leaped lightly
to one side, fearing an ambush.</p>

<p>A dead silence followed.</p>

<p>“Lights here!” commanded Bindloss, stepping
in with revolver thrust before him.</p>

<p>Nothing happening, cowpunchers and Overlanders
crowded in. They found the old rancher
standing with a dazed expression on his face.</p>

<p>“Gosh a-mighty!” he muttered over and over.
“What’s happened?”</p>

<p>It was then that the Overlanders discovered
the two bound men, and then Hippy at some
little distance from them, stretched out on his
face, one hand still grasping his revolver.</p>

<p>“Hippy!” It was a wailing cry from Nora as
she threw herself down beside him. “He’s dead!
He’s dead! They’ve killed him!” Nora threw
both arms about her husband and tried to turn
him over, but he was a dead weight and she
failed.</p>

<p>Tom did it for her, the cowpunchers during all
this time standing with gaping mouths as dazed
as was their employer.</p>

<p>Grace and Elfreda were at Hippy’s side in an
instant, and it was Elfreda who discovered that
he was not dead.</p>

<p>“Light here, please,” requested Miss Briggs in
a tone so calm that it steadied the others of the
party. “Look at this, will you?” she added.
“A bullet has ripped the bandage from his head,
and torn open the stitches that I put in Hippy’s
scalp.”</p>

<p>“Wounded in exactly the same place!” murmured
Grace. “How strange!”</p>

<p>“What ’bout these cayuses, Boss?” demanded
Two-gun Pete, fixing a malignant gaze on the
two helpless ruffians who were looking from one
to the other of the party with anxiety in their
eyes. “Shall I make a good job of it an’ sarve
’em the same way somebody has sarved the
Dude?”</p>

<p>“Shut up! They’ll keep. This man gets first
attention. Is he bad off, Miss?” questioned
Bindloss.</p>

<p>“I can’t say,” answered Elfreda. “If I knew
how long he has been in this condition I might
make a better guess.”</p>

<p>Pete released the gun from Hippy’s hand, felt
of the barrel, smelled of the muzzle, then looked
into the cylinder to see how many shots had
been fired from it.</p>

<p>“Ain’t been this way more’n ten or fifteen
minutes, I reckon. Gun’s warm yit.”</p>

<p>“Then it may be only concussion of the brain,
but I shan’t be able to tell definitely for some
little time. Some one run to camp and get bandages.
Tom, will you please go? Fetch my case
along.”</p>

<p>Elfreda called for water and by the time Tom
returned had bathed the wound, the same wound
reopened, though the scalp on either side of it
was lacerated somewhat more than before. Restoratives
were administered by Grace, while
Elfreda was dressing and re-sewing the wound,
she believing it best to do this before the patient
recovered consciousness. Grace was not so successful,
and at Bindloss’s orders the cowpunchers
picked up the wounded Overlander and carried
him to his bed at the back of the house.</p>

<p>“Take the gags out of them fellers’ mouths.
I reckon they’ll have something to say,” drawled
Bindloss in the cool tone that his men knew from
experience was a mask for a raging passion
beneath it.</p>

<p>The gags were none too gently removed, the
captives’ weapons were jerked from their belts,
smelled of and examined and found not to have
been fired that evening. This was evidenced by
the fact that the cylinders were fully loaded, that
the barrels were cold, and that there was no odor
of burnt powder to be detected at the muzzles.</p>

<p>“Stand ’em up against the wall and let’s have
a look at ’em!” commanded the rancher, and
after this had been done, and one of the cowboys
had held a lantern up to their faces, Bindloss
squinted at them frowningly. “Any of you
fellows know these critters?”</p>

<p>Each cowpuncher stepped up and took a long,
stern look at the faces and shook his head.</p>

<p>“I reckon you two bit off more’n you could
chew, eh? Who are ye?” demanded Bindloss.</p>

<p>The captives, now sullen-faced, made no reply.</p>

<p>“What happened that you two are hog-tied in
my house?”</p>

<p>“Ain’t no use fer to ask questions ’cause you
ain’t goin’ to git no answers,” growled one.</p>

<p>“I’ll tell ye what happened,” spoke up the
other captive. “We was ridin’ by, an knowin’
thet you-all was down the range, seen somethin’
was goin’ on in heah an’ we jest come up to look
in, an’ got a crack on the haid. Thet’s all.”</p>

<p>“You’re a liar!” blazed Joe Bindloss, drawing
back a clenched fist as if to strike the man, but
the fist slowly relaxed and his face grew calm
again. “You’ll talk before I git done with you,
I promise you that. When the man in there
wakes up, if he ever does, I’ll hear the truth.
If he dies I’ll shoot every man in these ranges
if I have to do so to git the right ones, and I’ll
begin with you, you sneaking coyotes! Take ’em
out and tie ’em in the barn. And, boys, fix ’em
so they can’t get away. If there’s any rough
stuff to be pulled off, I’ll do the pulling. Understand?”</p>

<p>The cowpunchers nodded and picked up the
prisoners. When outside the door the man at the
head of each prisoner dropped his burden and the
cowboy at the foot dragged his captive by the
feet all the way to the stable. Sam Conifer
followed and stood gazing at the prisoners as the
cowmen were re-tying them. He was positive
that he had seen one of the ruffians before, but
could not place him.</p>

<p>While this was going on, Jim, who had procured
a lantern and browsed about the ranch, returned
to the house. Bindloss was in the room
with Lieutenant Wingate at the moment, watching
the Overland girls work over him. Hearing
Jim enter, he stepped out.</p>

<p>“Oh! It’s you, is it?”</p>

<p>“Yes. Boss, I been lookin’ ’round heah a little
an’ I’ve diskivered some things. Thar was seven
men in that party. They went up to our camp
fust, but didn’t take nothin’. Then they come
down heah an’ tried to git in the corral. Thar’s
some bullet holes in the posts thar, which I reckon
was made by Lieutenant Wingate’s rifle. Thar’s
a rifle on the floor thar. Whose is that?”</p>

<p>“Mine,” exclaimed the rancher, picking up the
weapon and examining it. “The magazine is
empty—fired off this evening.”</p>

<p>“Jest so. Some of them bullets is in the stable
now, an’ some more of ’em hit them rough-necks,
mebby killed ’em, I can’t say. Leastwise they
left some blood where two of ’em lay until they
was carried away on hosses. Thar’s tracks, too,
that lead right up to that winder thar.”</p>

<p>“Good work,” complimented Bindloss. “What
beats me, though, is how two of them happened
to be tied down in the house.”</p>

<p>“Three of ’em I trailed up to the winder. One
of ’em went away in a hurry, but t’other two
didn’t. I reckon mebby they aire the two fellers
that ye found heah. The party went south after
they heard ye comin’. I reckon that’s what
started ’em away. I reckon they was tryin’ to
steal yer mustangs when Lieutenant Wingate put
er crimp in their little picnic. Eh, Boss?”</p>

<p>“I reckon you’re right, Jim. He must have
fought them single-handed and when they were
getting the worst of it they tried to set fire
to the ranch-house. I reckon we got here just
in time.”</p>

<p>“Yep. Things do work out queer-like sometimes,”
agreed the old guide. “Somebody’s
comin’! They’re in a hurry, too,” he warned.</p>

<p>A horse came to a sliding stop just outside of
the ranch-house. A rapid exchange of words followed
between the rider and the cowboys, then
a dust-covered, breathless cowboy clanked in.</p>

<p>“Gosh a-mighty! What’s broke loose now?”
demanded the rancher. “Don’t tell me something
else has happened. Speak up! Are you
tongue-tied?”</p>

<p>“The herd, Pop’s herd, has jest been stampeded
an’ scattered into the foothills, and Pop’s been
shot. The fellers thet stampeded the herd give
him his’n. They aire bringin’ him in now,” answered
the rider excitedly.</p>

<p>Bindloss snatched up his rifle and bolted from
the door. His cowpunchers already were in their
saddles.</p>

<p>“Grace, if I am not needed here, I’ll go, too,”
urged Tom.</p>

<p>“Yes, do,” answered Grace Harlowe. “Tell
Jim-Sam to stay. Be careful, Tom.”</p>

<p>“Safety first,” called back the Overland Rider
as he dashed out after the rancher. “Jim-Sam,
I hold you responsible for the safety of this place
while we are away.”</p>

<p>“Come on if you’re going with me,” shouted
Bindloss.</p>

<p>“I’m with you,” answered Tom, and in an incredibly
short time the party was thundering
down the valley.</p>

<span>CHAPTER XIII</span><br />
<span>AN OVERLANDER IS MISSING</span>
</h2>

<p>The vigil of the Overland girls lasted
through the night. Along towards
morning Lieutenant Wingate’s breathing
became more natural and his heart action
better.</p>

<p>“I am inclined to think that he will regain
consciousness soon,” announced Miss Briggs.
“If he does, it is not a fracture of the skull. Have
courage, Nora,” she added in answer to the appealing
look from Mrs. Wingate, who had sat
holding the wounded man’s hand all night long.</p>

<p>“I’ve been trying to bring him back, and I’ve
thought so hard that I just knew he would have
to come back,” murmured Nora.</p>

<p>Grace kissed her and patted her cheek.</p>

<p>“The imponderable quality lies deep in us all,”
observed Emma more to herself than to her
companions.</p>

<p>In the meantime Jim and Sam were prowling
about, now and then looking in to inquire how
the patient was getting along, but spending a
good part of their time at the Overland camp
which commanded a fairly good view of the ranch
buildings.</p>

<p>Shortly after daybreak, Hippy stirred and
began to mutter. A few moments later he opened
his eyes, blinked a few times, and smiled up into
Nora’s face. The Overland girl burst into tears.</p>

<p>“If you don’t stop that at once out you go!”
threatened Miss Briggs. “Hippy must have
absolute quiet. Which shall it be?”</p>

<p>“I’ll be quiet,” promised Nora, conquering the
sobs that rose to her lips.</p>

<p>There was instant silence in the room, and in
a few moments Hippy Wingate sank into a
natural sleep, from which he did not awaken until
late in the morning. After some nourishment was
given him, he asked for explanations.</p>

<p>The girls told him how they had found him,
and asked him what had occurred before he was
put out by a bullet. Hippy related all that he
could remember of the occurrences of the previous
night. They then insisted on his going to sleep
again, which he was quite willing and ready to do.</p>

<p>No one had been near the stable where the
prisoners were held, though Jim-Sam had made
occasional tours of inspection about the building
throughout the night. The key to the stable
was in the pocket of Two-gun Pete, so, though
the prisoners must be hungry, it was plain that
they would get nothing to eat until the return
of the rancher and his party.</p>

<p>Bindloss, and those that had gone out with
him, returned shortly before noon worn and angry.
Emma met them in front of the ranch-house
waving her hat and smiling.</p>

<p>“It’s all right,” she cried in answer to a volley
of questions about Hippy. “He is sleeping now.”</p>

<p>“Whoo—pe-e-e!” howled the boys.</p>

<p>“Shut up! The man’s asleep!” rebuked Joe
Bindloss, getting down from his saddle and
stamping about to get the kinks out of his
legs, for he had not been out of the saddle in
many hours.</p>

<p>At this juncture Grace appeared at the door
of the ranch-house and waved a hand at them.</p>

<p>“The lieutenant is awake now and he would
like to see you, Mr. Bindloss,” she informed the
rancher.</p>

<p>Bindloss limped in, and the cowboys, not to be
denied what they were certain would prove to be
an interesting interview, flung themselves from
their ponies and trooped in. They were crowded
about the door of the injured man’s room by the
time Joe Bindloss gripped the Overland Rider’s
hand.</p>

<p>Hippy sat propped up in bed, his head swathed
in bandages, and he grinned at the solemn faces
of the cowpunchers.</p>

<p>“I got mine again, fellows. Regular tenderfoot,
eh?”</p>

<p>The cowpunchers shook their heads.</p>

<p>“Wal, now, tell me ’bout it,” urged the rancher.</p>

<p>To save Hippy from another wearisome recital,
Miss Briggs repeated what he had already related
of his experiences. The lines of the cowboy countenances
grew taut during the recital, but no
word was uttered. They were held by the words
of Elfreda Briggs, spoken without attempt at embellishment.</p>

<p>“An’ you got two of ’em. Well, I’ll be struck
dead if that ain’t the limit. Boys, what do you
think ’bout this outfit being tenderfeet?” he demanded,
turning brusquely to his men.</p>

<p>The cowboys shifted uneasily and fumbled their
hats.</p>

<p>“Boss, I reckon we got to git somebody fer
thet. What ’bout Pop? Is he daid?” demanded
Idaho.</p>

<p>“No. He isn’t badly hurt. Shot through the
shoulder, that’s all,” smiled J. Elfreda. “He is
in the bunk-house. Mrs. Gray fixed him up and
Sam has been looking after him. I shall go over
again soon and look him over. The lieutenant
being the worse hurt demanded most of our
attention, though Pop has not been neglected,”
Elfreda informed them.</p>

<p>“I think the prisoners may need attention by
this time,” suggested Grace. “They must be
hungry.”</p>

<p>Bindloss growled.</p>

<p>“All right. Pete, see that they get something
to eat. Find out if they are ready to talk and
let me know.”</p>

<p>“Thank you,” said Grace smilingly.</p>

<p>“Hippy, you’ve done me a big service. I don’t
know what to say,” resumed the rancher.</p>

<p>“Don’t say anything. I had to fight to save
my own skin,” answered Hippy.</p>

<p>“A good many folks would have hid in the
cellar,” chuckled Bindloss. “Catching those two
rough-necks was the cleverest thing that’s been
done in Coso Valley, and I reckon the record will
stand for some time. Feel all right?”</p>

<p>“Sore, but happy, Mr. Bindloss. Tell me what
happened below. The girls said there was trouble
with the Number Six herd and that Pop had been
wounded.”</p>

<p>Bindloss’s face contracted.</p>

<p>“The miserable coyotes! I mean that mountain
gang. Yes, they stampeded the herd and
run them into the foothills. They got some of
the stock, too, but I don’t know how many head.
The whole bunch got away before we got down
there, though they left several snipers as a sort
of rear guard, and they took pot shots at us when
the boys tried to get on the trail of the stolen
stock. We got the stock rounded up, what was
left of it, and drove it in with another herd. The
boys are finishing rounding up on that section
today. I reckon they can get along without me.
Pete and the bunch are going back later. We’ve
got two of the thieves here, anyway, and they
are going to jail when we get ready to turn them
over. I reckon they are going to talk some first,
though.”</p>

<p>“Can’t your men trail the rustlers?” asked
Miss Briggs.</p>

<p>“Not far. You don’t know these mountains.
They could hide up a bunch of cattle for months
and no one could find them unless he just happened
to stumble onto the hiding place. The best
we can do is to find out who the boss of that
thieving outfit is and shoot him up. I reckon
that’s what’s going to be did, too. By the way,
where’s your fat friend, Stacy? It’s a wonder he
isn’t around with some suggestions to offer.”</p>

<p>The Overlanders looked at each other with
growing concern in their faces.</p>

<p>“St—acy!” exclaimed Nora.</p>

<p>“Mercy! With all the excitement we have
forgotten all about that young man,” spoke up
Emma. “Why, he didn’t return with us last
night, did he?”</p>

<p>“He is all right. Don’t worry. You will find
him with the punchers rounding up steers and
howling like an Indian,” soothed Lieutenant
Wingate.</p>

<p>Bindloss strode to the door and shouted
“Pete!” Two-gun came running.</p>

<p>“Whar’s Brown, Stacy Brown?”</p>

<p>“I—I thought he was heah. Ain’t he?”</p>

<p>“No. Was he with the men rounding up this
morning?”</p>

<p>Pete shook his head and a troubled look crept
into his face.</p>

<p>“When did you last see him?”</p>

<p>“Le’ me see. It was last night jest before we
got er call to come up heah. He was ridin’ up
towards the foothills on the east side, I reckon
to see what the boys was doin’ up thet way. As
I recommember thar warn’t any of the boys on
thet side jest then.”</p>

<p>“You are certain that he isn’t with the outfit?”
urged Bindloss.</p>

<p>“Daid shore, Boss.”</p>

<p>“Then where is he?” demanded the rancher
with a rising inflection in his voice.</p>

<p>Two-gun Pete shook his head and ran his
fingers through his hair.</p>

<p>“I reckon somethin’ has happened to thet
feller,” he observed solemnly.</p>

<p>Tom Gray ran to the door and shouted for
Jim-Sam.</p>

<p>“We will start the guides out at once. Something
has gone wrong with Chunky, that’s certain,
but if anyone can find him Jim-Sam can,” he said.</p>

<p>“I’ll send Pete and a couple of the others with
them,” announced the rancher, who was more disturbed
than he cared to have the Overland Riders
see. “Pete! You know what to do. Get the
boy, that’s all.”</p>

<p>Jim-Sam were entering the ranch-house when
Idaho burst in, thrusting the guides aside at the
door.</p>

<p>“Boss! They’ve gone!” yelled Idaho.</p>

<p>“Gone? Who’s gone?”</p>

<p>“The critters thet the Dude caught last night.
They’ve got clean away. Somebody sawed a hole
in the back of the stable and got ’em out!”</p>

<p>“Gosh a-mighty!” gasped Bindloss. “I ought
to have done what I wanted to do and shot ’em
both. But I’ll do it yet! I’ll do it yet!” he
raged, stalking from the ranch-house on his way
to the scene of the escape.</p>
</div>

<div class='chapter'>
<h2 id='chXIV' title='XIV: THE LOST TRAIL'>
<span>CHAPTER XIV</span><br />
<span>THE LOST TRAIL</span>
</h2>

<p>“I am going back to the round-up, then
over to see Malcolm Hornby,” announced
Joe Bindloss after returning from the
stable, where he had gone to see for himself how
the prisoners had escaped. “I hate the critter,
but if we stock owners don’t get together and
organize to wipe out these thieves we shan’t have
any stock left by the end of the season.”</p>

<p>“I’ll go with you,” offered Tom Gray.</p>

<p>“Sure, if you like. Pete, you and Idaho are to
ride with us, leaving the rest here to protect the
ranch. We mustn’t leave the place alone again,
but there’s got to be some better protecting than
there was last night,” warned Bindloss. “I’ll bet
every steer on my ranch that if Lieutenant Wingate
had been on his feet they wouldn’t have got
away—alive!”</p>

<p>“Tom, I am going, too,” announced Grace.</p>

<p>“Rough riding, girlie,” reminded Tom.</p>

<p>“Yes, I know. But I don’t mind. Elfreda will
remain with Hippy who will be all right if
someone doesn’t fire more bullets into him. She and
Nora may be trusted to take good care of him.
Perhaps Emma would like to go, too, especially
if that big cowboy Pete is to accompany us,”
added Grace laughingly.</p>

<p>“Come along. You won’t be satisfied unless
you do,” agreed Tom. “I will speak to Bindloss
about it.”</p>

<p>Grace said that there was no need to do that,
and suggested further that she thought she might
be of some assistance to the searchers, but the
Overland girl did not explain what she meant by
her last remark, nor did Tom think twice about it.
His mind was troubled.</p>

<p>Emma answered the question of her joining the
party before it was asked by announcing that she
was going to ride with Two-gun Pete and Mr.
Bindloss.</p>

<p>Arrangements were quickly made and after the
situation had been explained to Lieutenant Wingate,
Nora and Emma, the rancher and his party
mounted their ponies, leaving Sierra in charge of
the ranch with another cowboy and Sam Conifer
to assist him.</p>

<p>“Do as well as ye did last night when ye let
them fellers git away an’ ye prob’bly’ll git yer
fool haid shot off,” warned Sam as Jim swung
into his saddle.</p>

<p>“That’s all right so long as we leave another
wuss fool heah at the ranch,” gave back Jim, and
the party galloped away.</p>

<p>It was a hard ride, especially for Emma and
Grace, but both girls stood up under it remarkably
well. Only one stop was made and that was
at a spring to water the ponies, after which the
journey was resumed. The rancher and his party
reached their destination about the middle of the
afternoon, where the same scenes were being enacted
as on the previous day. Cattle were milling
and bawling, and above the roar came the calls
of the cowpunchers, clear and distinct.</p>

<p>The herd engaged in the milling was much
smaller than before because so many head had
been cut out and sent to graze at another place,
there to be guarded by men who would see to it
that they neither got away nor were stolen, for
these cattle soon were to be driven to market.</p>

<p>At Bindloss’s direction, the men of the party
separated and rode out to question the cowmen
about Stacy, and after every man there had been
interviewed, the searchers returned to the knoll
where the girls were awaiting them.</p>

<p>“He hasn’t been here since last night,” Tom
informed them. “The last seen of him was when
he was riding up towards that knoll yonder where
you see the red bushes. Whether or not he came
back, no one seems to know.”</p>

<p>“Then he possibly rode into the mountains and
got lost,” suggested Emma. “That would be just
like Stacy.”</p>

<p>“I wish I might believe that it was nothing
worse,” answered Grace. “What is your idea, Mr.
Bindloss?”</p>

<p>“That’s a fair question, and I’ll give you a
fair answer. It is my hunch that the bunch that
attacked the ranch is concerned in this case too.
I’m going over to see Hornby, and you folks can
either wait here for me or return to the ranch.”</p>

<p>Grace asked permission to accompany him,
which was rather begrudgingly granted, she
thought. Emma elected to stay and watch the
herding, and more especially to watch Two-gun
Pete’s antics with his mustang and tell him he was
the finest horseman in the world. Emma had
told that same thing to nearly every one of Old
Joe Bindloss’s punchers, and some day it was destined
to result in a lively man-to-man fight.</p>

<p>The ride to Hornby’s ranch occupied less than
an hour, and Grace observed that Bindloss hailed
the log cabin where Hornby lived, while still some
little distance away. Judy answered the call and
looked her amazement when she saw who the
callers were.</p>

<p>“Pap’s got an awful grouch on today. You’d
better light out of here hot-foot, Pap Bindloss.”</p>

<p>“Judy, I’m going to see your father. Where
may I find him?”</p>

<p>“I reckon right heah! What do ye want?”
The voice belonged to Malcolm Hornby.</p>

<p>Grace observed the man with keen interest.
Hornby was short and wiry, his eyes keen, but
revealing a vicious temper, while his face, probably
from exposure to the open, was like wrinkled
parchment. Yet he was not an old man, perhaps
not more than fifty, with a quick, nervous manner
that made one feel he would be a dangerous
opponent in a fight.</p>

<p>“I want to talk with you, Hornby. Can we
talk in private?” asked Bindloss. “I want
to talk with you about two things. The first is
about a young friend of mine named Stacy Brown
who disappeared from the round-up last night,
pony and all. I want your judgment, too. You
know these hills better than I do.”</p>

<p>“I don’t know nothin’ ’bout it. Why do ye
come heah? Ye don’t think I stole him, do ye?”
The question was put with savage emphasis.</p>

<p>“Don’t be foolish, Hornby. I need your advice,
for I’m plumb locoed on this business,” urged the
rancher.</p>

<p>“Is that all ye got to say?”</p>

<p>“No. I have something else to say. Hornby,
we’re neighbors, not very good ones, but we’re
neighbors just the same, and neighbors should
stand together. I suppose the rustlers have been
at your herd as well as mine.”</p>

<p>“I reckon if they keeps on I won’t have a
steer on four feet left,” growled Hornby.</p>

<p>“Then will you join in with me, turn your men
over and make a big drive with me to rid this
part of the country of all those critters?”</p>

<p>“I reckon you an’ me couldn’t hitch up fer
anything. We’d be for shootin’ each other up
’fore we’d got out of the valley. You’ve got a
rotten temper, an’ when I’m riled up I ain’t no
good company either. Who be these folks that
ye say is yer friends?”</p>

<p>“They are my friends, and that’s all that need
be said,” retorted Bindloss with some heat, for
he did not like the tone nor the insinuation in
Hornby’s reply.</p>

<p>While the men were talking, Grace had dismounted
and she and Judy had strolled away and
engaged in earnest conversation, during which
Grace told her all that had happened at the Circle
O ranch. What Grace especially wanted to convey
was that, knowing the mountains as she did,
Judy might be able to assist them in finding out
what had happened to Stacy. Judy shook her
head saying that she couldn’t. Grace closed the
subject instantly and walked back to Bindloss.</p>

<p>“Man!” cried the owner of the Circle O. “The
ruffians not only tried to steal the ponies right
out of my corral, but they shot my place all up
and hit my friend, Lieutenant Wingate. He
caught two of them and shot some others, I
reckon, but the two got away later on with the
assistance of their friends. I’ve reached my limit,
Hornby. The next thing I know I’ll be killing
somebody.”</p>

<p>“Providin’ they don’t git ye first,” leered
Hornby. “I said ye had a rotten temper, and
ye’ve proved it. Nope, Joe, you an’ me can’t
hitch up nohow. I’ll run my own shebang and
I reckon ye can do the same with yours or quit.
I don’t give a dad-blasted rap which ye do. And
as fer thet Lootenant friend of yours, tell him
he’d better watch out and not git too handy
with thet gun o’ hissen, fer thar’s some rough
fellers in these mountains thet’d make hash of
him instanter if ever they sot eyes on him.
This ain’t no place for dudes, Joe Bindloss, an’
ye knows it as well as I do. Thet’s all I got to
say to ye.”</p>

<p>Malcolm Hornby turned on his heel and strode
into the house, ordering Judy to follow him.
Judy, with lowered eyes, followed obediently
without another word to Grace.</p>

<p>“How strangely that girl acts today, Mr. Bindloss,”
wondered Grace as she mounted her mustang
and trotted away with the rancher.</p>

<p>“Judy’s all right. The trouble is that old
Hornby is wearing her down with his ornery
temper until she is ’bout ready to bust out. I
hope she doesn’t, because if she does it’ll be a bad
day for Pap.”</p>

<p>“Has she no mother?”</p>

<p>“Mother died when she was a kid. That was
’bout the time I lost my wife. But I don’t altogether
understand what’s got into Judy. She’s
acting mighty queer.”</p>

<p>Grace nodded.</p>

<p>“There’s your man Jim up there,” said Bindloss,
pointing to the foothills where the Overland
guide was seen working about. At Grace’s suggestion
they rode to him. “Find it?” called the
rancher as he and Grace approached.</p>

<p>“I thought as I had, but thar’s been so many
cattle an’ so many hosses that it’s a lost trail.
The fellers say that Stacy war seen here’bouts.
If he’s smart he’s left some sort o’ trail, but I’ll
be shot if I kin find it.”</p>

<p>“He would not think of that,” answered Grace.</p>

<p>The pair rode on into the valley, both silent
and thoughtful, and for the rest of the afternoon
watched the work of rounding up. Just before
dark Grace joined by Emma rode over to the foothills
to see what Jim was accomplishing. He was
now nowhere to be seen. Though Emma wanted
to ride up farther into the hills, Grace decided that
it would not be prudent, for night was coming on.</p>

<p>They ate their supper with cowboys beside a
little campfire, and shortly after that started
homeward, accompanied by Mr. Bindloss and two
of the men. Two-gun Pete was one of the party.</p>

<p>All were pleased to learn, on their arrival at
the ranch, that Hippy had been sitting up and
was coming along. Pop Skinner too, Elfreda said,
was out of danger. Even the ranch-house had
improved under the repairs that had been made
that day.</p>

<p>Sam Conifer they found pacing about restlessly.
He was full of eager questions about Jim,
and seemed disturbed when they told him that
his partner probably had found a trail and was
following it.</p>

<p>On the following morning, with no tidings of
the old guide, Sam asked permission to go in
search of Jim. Permission was readily granted,
and Sam was soon galloping away.</p>

<p>Conifer did not return until the late afternoon
of the next day. He was riding hard when the
Overlanders discovered him, and reeled in his
saddle as he rode up to the ranch-house.</p>

<p>“Somethin’s happened to Jim!” he cried. “I
found whar it happened, and then I lost the trail.
They’ve got him! They’ve got him, folks!”</p>

<p>“Sam! Sam! You have been hurt!” cried
Nora. There was blood on Sam Conifer’s face,
and the left arm hung limp at his side. Before
they could assist him, Sam essayed to dismount
and pitched to the ground in a dead faint.</p>
</div>

<h2 id='chXV' title='XV: CLEWS THAT WERE LOADED'>
<span>CHAPTER XV</span><br />
<span>CLEWS THAT WERE LOADED</span>
</h2>

<p>It was found that a bullet had hit the fleshy
part of the old guide’s left arm, and that
there was considerable laceration. First aid
was administered and the patient restored to consciousness.</p>

<p>“Quite a hospital we have here, Mr. Bindloss,”
observed J. Elfreda after she had done all
she could for Sam.</p>

<p>“A-huh! What made the old fellow faint
like that? He must be getting old.”</p>

<p>“Loss of blood made him faint. So it would
you. He will shortly be able to tell us how he got
the wound.”</p>

<p>“I’ll talk now. I’m so full of it I’ve got to talk.
I’m an old idiot! No mistake ’bout that,” rumbled
Sam. “I must talk, fer somethin’ has got
to be did. They’ve got Jim, an’ I reckons they’ve
got the fat boy, too.”</p>

<p>“Take it easy like,” urged the rancher. “No
hurry at all. Does he want something to eat?”</p>

<p>“We are preparing something. Pete has killed
a chicken and Nora is making broth for him,”
replied Miss Briggs.</p>

<p>“Huh! Reckon you folks think you own this
ranch, eh?” demanded the owner, his eyes
twinkling.</p>

<p>“We might were we to sue for the damage we
have sustained here,” retorted Emma snappily.</p>

<p>“Oh, ho! I reckon you’re right,” agreed Bindloss.
“What’s on your mind, Conifer?”</p>

<p>“I found the trail!”</p>

<p>“You did?” cried Tom Gray.</p>

<p>“Yes, but that ain’t all. It was a fixed trail
to make the finder reckon that Jim had made it
hisself so we could foller him. I swallered the
bait an’ the hook an’ the line too. I fust found
whar thar’d been a scrimmage, an’ I found Jim’s
heel marks right thar. Then they disappeared
jest as if he’d gone up into the air. He’d been
boosted to the back of a hoss. Ye never seen no
hoss track so a-mighty plain. Well, I follered
right on. Jim wouldn’t have made that mistake.
He’d jest kinder sneaked. Then I got mine.”</p>

<p>“How far into the hills did you get?”
interrupted the rancher.</p>

<p>“’bout half a mile. Wal, as I was sayin’, all
of a sudden I heard somethin’ like someone had
stepped on a stick back of some juniper bushes.
I didn’t like thet sound; I knowed thar was a
gun behind it, so I jest naturally got ready for
trouble, but trouble got me first. The feller shot,
an’ I shot. The only difference was thet he had
a plain mark to shoot at an’ I didn’t. He hit me
in the arm, an’ then I shot thet Juniper bush so
full of holes that it won’t make no shade till next
summer.”</p>

<p>“Did—did you hit him?” questioned Emma
eagerly.</p>

<p>“I hit somethin’ that grunted, but the grunter
got away from me. I stalked him fer two hour,
but couldn’t even find his tracks, though I did
find some blood thar, an’ if he’d a looked he’d
found a heap sight more blood whar I was. If
thet feller hit what he shot at thar’s only one man
in this heah neck of the world thet could do it,
an’ he’s the feller I’m lookin’ fer. When I find
him, one or t’other of us’ll go down an’ stay
down. Thet’s shore,” threatened Sam grimly.</p>

<p>“I don’t understand how Jim could have been
caught in broad daylight,” wondered Tom.</p>

<p>“Thar’s only one way, onless they shot him,
which I don’t reckon they did, jedging from the
look of the trail. Folks, they roped him jest like
they’d rope an old maverick steer. I reckon
mebby that’s what happened to Stacy.”</p>

<p>“Yes. But why, why?”</p>

<p>“Ye kin search me. I’ll be all right after I
gits a few hours’ sleep an’ some chuck; then I’m
goin’ to hit the trail agin, and I’ll bet ye this
trail won’t be loaded. Leastwise, I’ll dodge the
loaded places.”</p>

<p>“Samuel, you will not be hitting any trail just
yet,” admonished Miss Briggs. “I think you had
better stop talking now. Your broth will be
ready in a few moments, after which you are
going to sleep.” Elfreda motioned to the others
to leave, which they did, and half an hour later
Sam was sleeping soundly. Elfreda thereupon
went out to the front porch where Bindloss, Tom
and the others of the Overland party were
awaiting her.</p>

<p>Bindloss said they had been discussing the
situation, and that not only for their sakes, but
for the sake of his business in the Coso Valley,
something must be done to check the outlawry
that had been going on and that was getting
worse.</p>

<p>“Have you appealed to the law?” asked Miss
Briggs.</p>

<p>The rancher laughed, but without mirth.</p>

<p>“The sheriff has been after this gang for three
months, but that’s as far as the law has ever
got. The law has never caught up with the gang.
There’s some fellow with a head bossing that
gang, and they ought to be getting rich judging
from the stock they’ve stolen from me.”</p>

<p>“If you wish to make a drive and try to clean
them up perhaps we can assist you,” offered Tom.</p>

<p>“I’ve been thinking of that,” replied Bindloss
reflectively. “I don’t reckon, though, that I
want you folks to get mixed up in it, for somebody
is sure to get hurt,” he added.</p>

<p>“It occurs to me that someone already has,”
observed Miss Briggs wisely. “You must remember
that, having lost one of our party and
one guide, we are not wholly disinterested spectators,
and should Stacy not get back, we probably
shall organize a drive on our own hook.”</p>

<p>“What are your plans, Bindloss? What have
you in mind?” asked Tom Gray.</p>

<p>“’Bout that matter? I can’t do anything till
we get finished with the round-up. When that’s
done we’ll turn some of our cowpunchers loose,
letting Pete lead them, for Pete is a natural leader
and can shoot, and he knows the mountains better
than any other fellow on the range. In the meantime,
if Sam gets fit, we will ask him to scout and
see if he can find the hang-out of the ruffians. It
will be a ticklish job, but I suppose it can be done.
Miss Briggs, when do you think the old man will
be able to start?”</p>

<p>“He should lay up for a week, but I do not
believe it will be possible to hold him that
long,” replied Elfreda.</p>

<p>“Leave Stacy all that time without doing anything
to help him?” wailed Nora.</p>

<p>Grace explained that all was being done that
could be done, and that a few days more or less
probably would be none the worse for the missing
Overland boy. She said the delay would enable
them to perfect their plans for the proposed man-hunt,
and that in the meantime the ruffians might
make a slip and place themselves in the hands of
the men of Circle O. Bindloss nodded his approval,
and there the matter was left.</p>

<p>Conifer improved much more rapidly than
Elfreda had thought possible and two days later
Hippy, on his feet again, was walking about, limping
ever so little, his head swathed in bandages
and his face lined and pale.</p>

<p>“I’ve been down long enough,” he told Bindloss.
“It is time that I was out and looking for
that nephew of mine, Chunky Brown. Conifer
declares that he is going out tomorrow and I’m
going with him.”</p>

<p>“You are not,” replied the rancher. “Man,
it’ll kill you! Conifer wasn’t hit like you and
he has his right hand as good as ever. There’s
lots of fight left in the old man yet, and if we
don’t let him go he will worry himself and the rest
of us to death. No, Lieutenant, you keep your
hosses staked down and get lazy for a few days
more. I promise you there will be plenty of
excitement and activity for you and the rest of
us when we start that man hunt.”</p>

<p>The Overlanders were as emphatic as Bindloss
had been, and Hippy, much against his will, submitted
to their demand that he stay at the ranch.
Conifer, too, was ordered by Miss Briggs to defer
his departure, so that it was the latter part of
that week before she gave him permission to take
the trail on the following day.</p>

<p>That night, however, something occurred to
change the plans of Bindloss and his guests.
Two-gun Pete, who had come in late from the
range, had discovered a man prowling about the
stable. Pete hailed him and the man ran, whereupon
the cowboy fired six shots at him, but in the
darkness all his bullets went wild.</p>

<p>The firing awakened the occupants of the ranch-house
and the Overland camp, and in a few
minutes all hands were on the scene, armed and
ready for whatever might be required of them.
Guards were thrown out to protect the place from
a surprise attack. The prowler had disappeared,
but he had left a plain trail to a point where his
mustang had been staked down. From there his
tracks led into the foothills, but the direction he
took upon entering the hills was no indication of
his probable destination.</p>

<p>“I found something,” shouted Idaho who had
just come around the corner of the corral with his
lantern and passed down at the rear of the stable.
The Overlanders and Bindloss found him carrying
a large basket at arm’s length. Idaho plainly was
suspicious of that basket, and he proposed to take
no chances with it. For all he knew it might be
full of rattlers.</p>

<p>No one made a move to investigate the basket’s
contents as Idaho put it down on the ground and
backed away.</p>

<p>“Perhaps the man went away in such haste he
forgot his luncheon,” suggested Emma whimsically,
which caused a laugh and relieved the
tension somewhat.</p>

<p>“You are a lot of tenderfeet,” averred Hippy,
limping over and peering down at the basket.
He gave it a gentle shake.</p>

<p>“Oh, Hippy darlin’! Be careful,” begged
Nora.</p>

<p>“Be quiet! There is something alive in here,”
warned Lieutenant Wingate, giving the basket
another shake, whereupon his companions distinctly
heard familiar sounds coming from it.</p>

<p>“Birds! Well, what do you folks know about
that? Someone has made us a present of a basket
of birds, perhaps blackbirds with which to
make a pie,” chortled Hippy.</p>

<p>The basket cover was secured with a piece of
wire, which the Overlander unwound and cautiously
peered within while Tom Gray held a
lantern to enable Hippy to see. He thrust a hand
in and brought out a bird, holding it up for the
others to look at.</p>

<p>“Bindloss, what do you think of our present?”
he cried jovially.</p>

<p>“Well, I’ll be shot!” exclaimed the rancher.
“What fool is carrying ’round a basket of birds?”
The rancher laughed uproariously.</p>

<p>Tom Gray took one look at the bird and uttered
an exclamation under his breath, then after
cautiously peering into the basket, being careful
that none of the other birds there made its escape,
he got up and faced his companions with a puzzled
expression in his eyes.</p>

<p>At this instant, Grace and Elfreda also discovered
what both Tom and Hippy already knew.</p>

<p>“A carrier pigeon!” exclaimed Miss Briggs
wonderingly. “Are they all carriers?”</p>

<p>“All carriers, and fully equipped for business,”
Tom informed them. “Are we back in France
in the war?”</p>

<p>Hippy turned the basket about so that the light
would shine on the other side of it, and made a
fresh discovery, more important, even, than the
discovery of the carrier pigeons. They heard him
utter an exclamation and saw him remove something
that was hanging to the handle and tied to
it with a leather thong.</p>

<h2 id='chXVI' title='XVI: THE CARRIER PIGEONS’ FLIGHT'>

<span>THE CARRIER PIGEONS’ FLIGHT</span>
</h2>

<p>“A letter!” cried Emma. “Isn’t this
perfectly romantic?”</p>

<p>“If it is a letter, it’s a crumby
looking one,” observed Hippy. “Tom, hold that
lantern so I can see.”</p>

<p>The Overlanders crowded up closer, with Bindloss
in the forefront, the cowpunchers peering over
their heads and shoulders, as Hippy began to unfold
a sheet that had once been wrapping paper.
One keen look at it and Lieutenant Wingate
uttered a yell and began hopping up and down
with most of his weight on one foot.</p>

<p>“Chunky! It’s from Chunky,” he cried.</p>

<p>“Read it! This suspense is killing me,” wailed
Emma.</p>

<p>“It is addressed to the Overlanders and to Joe
Bindloss. He spells it ‘Bindlass,’ and—”</p>

<p>“Never mind the spelling. Read it!” urged
Miss Briggs.</p>

<p>“And it reads as follows,” continued Hippy.</p>

<p>“‘Dear Folks: You’ll be surprised to hear from
me, and more so to hear that I’m in Dutch. I’m
in the hands of a gang of ruffians—gentlemen—’
The word ruffians has been crossed out and the
word gentlemen added,” explained Hippy.</p>

<p>“You are the most aggravating person I ever
knew. Will you please read that letter or let me
do it for you?” begged Miss Briggs.</p>

<p>“‘They caught me with a rope when I wasn’t
looking, down by the round-up, and I’ve stayed
caught. They know that I’m valuable and they
want a price for me,’” continued Hippy, reading
Stacy’s scrawl with considerable difficulty. “‘If
they don’t get it they propose to throw me off the
mountain into the red gulch just back of the
cabin that I’m in. They want five hundred
dollars for me and you’re to send it by the birds
that they are going to send with this letter. Put
only one bill on each bird’s leg because they’re
union birds and won’t carry a man-sized load.
I don’t know how or where they got the birds,
but they’ve got ’em. I know because I’ve seen
’em. When they get the money they are going to
take me to the foothills and kick me out, but if
they don’t get it I’m to go out the way I told
you. Please hurry. I haven’t had a square meal
since I got tangled up with that fellow’s rope,
but the scenery certainly is fine up here. Help!
Help! Help!</p>

<p class='tar'>“(Signed) ‘Lovingly, <span class='sc'>Stacy</span>.’”</p>

<div id='i003' class='illus' style='margin-left:15%; width:70%'>
  <img src='images/i003.jpg' alt='' />
  <p class='sm'>“It’s from Chunky!”</p>
</div>

<p>“‘P.S. If you try to find me they say they will
throw me over anyway. If you haven’t big
enough bills, for the love of heaven keep on sending
small ones so long as the birds hold out, but
send them!’</p>

<p>“‘P.P.S. The beans they are feeding me on up
here are awful, but the coffee is worse. S.B.’</p>

<p>“‘P.P.P.S. They say they are going to send
this by rural free delivery, but if it’s as slow as it
is back home I won’t need any help by the time it
reaches you. For heaven sake, feed the birds and
give them plenty of pepper, so they’ll have pep
and hustle—’”</p>

<p>The message broke off suddenly as if the writer
had been interrupted, at least that was the way
the Overlanders construed it.</p>

<p>“Gosh a-mighty! If that ain’t the limit!”
exclaimed Bindloss. “How can those birds carry
money or anything else, and how will they get
back where the robbers want them to go?”</p>

<p>Tom Gray explained that carrier pigeons carried
messages in little oiled paper tubes such as these
birds had on their legs, and that when released
they got their direction quickly and flew straight
back to their cotes.</p>

<p>“I know! I know,” exclaimed Bindloss. “A
fellow over at Carrago had a flock of ’em, but the
government took ’em over after the war started.
They paid him five dollars a head for the birds,
then, after the war, what was left of ’em he bought
back from the government at twenty-five cents
a head.”</p>

<p>“There’s our clue,” interrupted Hippy.
“Should we fail otherwise we can find out who
the pigeon man is. But I don’t reckon we shall
need to do that. Folks, what is your idea?”</p>

<p>“I shouldn’t be in favor of paying five hundred
dollars for Stacy,” objected Emma. “If they
keep him long enough to get really acquainted
with him they will be glad to take a bargain-counter
price for him.”</p>

<p>Bindloss suggested that they go into the house,
and Tom asked him to invite Idaho and Pete to
go in with them, which was done. Sam Conifer
met them on the porch, and his first question was
whether or not they had heard from Jim. The
situation was quickly explained to him. When
informed that there was no news from the missing
Jim, the guide’s whiskers drooped.</p>

<p>“I reckon Jim’s thar, but they wouldn’t let the
boy writ ’bout it,” he exclaimed, his whiskers
suddenly bristling as of old. “I’ll git ’em!
They’ve played a card into my hands now!” he
raged. “I’ll follow ’em now.”</p>

<p>“Are you going to fly, Sam?” questioned
Emma. “That is the only way I know of to
follow birds.”</p>

<p>It was a poser. Two-gun Pete asked if he
might make a suggestion. His suggestion was
that they liberate a bird and watch its direction,
then follow out that direction until they finally
found the hiding place of the rustlers.</p>

<p>“Peter, you sure have brains,” complimented
Hippy.</p>

<p>“I love a man with brains,” bubbled Emma,
amid smiles and nods, all of which embarrassed
Two-gun very much.</p>

<p>“That’s the idea,” cried Tom. “Has anyone
additional suggestions to make?”</p>

<p>“I have,” answered Miss Briggs. “Peter has
given us something to work from, and all it needs
is elaboration. See what you think of this. Give
a bird five dollars and liberate him just after daylight,
as they used to do in France. Watch the
course he takes, then let our men take up positions
on that course as nearly in line with the bird’s
flight as possible, lining up about a mile apart.
At a certain hour we will free a second bird, also
with a five-dollar bill. One of our men on the
lookout will surely see it. The ruffians may be a
long way from here, but so long as the bird’s
course can be kept in sight, its home roost can
be found.”</p>

<p>“Good generalship,” agreed Tom, nodding.</p>

<p>“Right you are,” approved Bindloss. “But
five dollars! I don’t like to give them robbers
even five cents.”</p>

<p>“Sam, do you feel equal to going with us?”
asked Grace, turning to the old guide.</p>

<p>“I’m goin’, an’ I ain’t comin’ back till I gits
Jim,” he answered grimly.</p>

<p>“Five dollars sent out with each bird won’t
break us. That will make sixty dollars if we
send out the entire dozen, which is a pretty high
price to pay for Chunky,” declared Emma.</p>

<p>The Overlanders rebuked her, and after further
discussion it was decided to liberate the first bird
at daybreak and a second bird at noon. As soon
as the first carrier gave them the direction, the
men were to proceed singly into the hills, going
with as much secrecy and caution as possible, take
up positions and await the noon bird.</p>

<p>Miss Briggs suggested that the men arrange to
get in touch with each other at the end of the first
hour following the passage of each bird, and that
the first to discover the hiding place of the rustlers
was to go back and wait for his companions so
that they might attack in force.</p>

<p>“Gosh a-mighty!” cried Joe Bindloss. “Is
there anything that you folks can’t do?”</p>

<p>“One bird every two hours after twelve and
up to four, then send all but two between that
and six,” suggested Hippy. “Better keep two
over. Send a message with the last bird that
the last two birds of the lot will be liberated in
the morning, as soon as the rest of the money can
be procured. Now who is going? I, for one, am
going out.”</p>

<p>Every person present volunteered, but it was
finally settled that Sam, Pete, Idaho, Tom Gray
and Hippy should go. Sam insisted on taking the
lead, and the position was assigned to him. Bindloss
and some of his men were to remain at the
ranch-house to guard against a possible raid.</p>

<p>The party soon thereafter turned in for what
rest they could get, but first the birds were put
in a larger basket so that they might be more
comfortable and rest up for the journey ahead of
them.</p>

<p>The ranch-house inhabitants were astir before
daylight next morning. Food was given to the
birds as soon as day dawned, and a tube packed
with a five-dollar bill and a brief message that
the money would be sent along as rapidly as
possible was attached to a pigeon’s leg.</p>

<p>The sun was rising when Tom Gray brought
out the first pigeon that was to make the flight.</p>

<p>“The dove of peace! What?” chuckled Tom,
tossing the bird into the air.</p>

<p>The carrier pigeon fluttered about with rapidly
beating wings for a few seconds, then began
circling upwards, taking wider and wider circles
as it rose, every eye eagerly fixed on it. The
Overlanders had thought that its direction would
be east, but suddenly the bird straightened out,
taking a course a little south of west, heading for
the Coso Mountains.</p>

<p>“Everyone watch him!” urged Tom.</p>

<p>Grace and Elfreda were following the flight with
their glasses, but the keen eyes of the ranchers
needed no such aid, and readily followed the
flight until the bird had disappeared over a
mountain.</p>

<p>“I got it!” shouted Sam.</p>

<p>“So hev I,” announced Pete. “Got the landmarks
daid to rights. Be ye ready, Sam?”</p>

<p>Sam was, and after an uneasy half hour’s wait
he rode off to the south, jogging along slowly.
He was followed after an interval by Lieutenant
Wingate, and following him were Tom Gray, Two-gun
Pete and Idaho in the order named. Each
man knew that he might expect to be shot from
ambush, but the opportunity to meet up with the
mountain ruffians outweighed all other considerations.</p>

<p>In a short time all were out of sight, and the
party left at the ranch settled down to wait for
the hour when they were to liberate another
pigeon, and at the same time to listen with straining
ears for the sound of firing in the hills, which
each one momentarily expected to hear.</p>

<h2 id='chXVII' title='XVII: STACY DECIDES TO LEAVE'>
<span>CHAPTER XVII</span><br />
<span>STACY DECIDES TO LEAVE</span>
</h2>

<p>The night that Stacy Brown was roped
from his mustang he was put to sleep
with a whack applied to his head from
the butt of a revolver. When he awakened he
found himself lashed to the back of a pony, traveling
over a rough mountain trail. The pony was
being led and there were men ahead and men to
the rear. The fat boy could hear them speak
at intervals.</p>

<p>It did not seem to be a long journey, and the
party finally pulled up before a cabin that Stacy
observed was well hidden in a narrow rocky pass
that was approached on three sides by way of a
steep granite slope, while on the other side, as he
later learned, a precipitous gorge dropped away
for hundreds of feet.</p>

<p>The Overland boy was removed from the horse
and carried to a lean-to against the rear of the
cabin in which horse equipment and weapons
were stored. He was unceremoniously dumped
into this place and left to his own reflections. For
some time he heard men talking in the cabin,
then silence settled over the place. It was near
noon of the following day before food was brought
to him and his hands were freed. After eating
he was subjected to a grilling examination as to
who he was and what his party were doing in the
Coso Valley, and when he answered in his characteristic
independent way one of the ruffians
struck him a blow in the face that once more
put the Overland boy to sleep.</p>

<p>At least twice each night thereafter he was
asked the same questions, and each time the
interview ended in a blow or a violent kick until
Chunky was sore all over.</p>

<p>Occasionally he was permitted to sit or lie outdoors,
and at such times Stacy used his eyes and
ears to the best advantage. However, there was
little for him to see except the scenery that he
mentioned in his letter.</p>

<p>His captors were away most of the time, though
ordinarily there was one man prowling about,
principally engaged in surveying the surrounding
mountains from a vantage point on a rock. Then
one evening came the order to Stacy to write the
letter to the Overland party. He obeyed eagerly,
for he was anxious to get away at any price—so
long as the price was paid by someone other than
himself. Stacy had slight hopes, though, that
his companions would give so great a ransom.</p>

<p>It was early in the evening of the following
night when he heard more than the usual number
of voices in the cabin. Voices now and then
were pitched high, sometimes in anger. Stacy
cautiously rolled close to the door communicating
with the cabin and lay listening. His hopes rose
high when he learned that some of the birds had
returned with money. Two of the ruffians had
come in with tidings that four birds were still
missing, which revealed to Stacy the fact that
the pigeons were not kept at the cabin. The one,
however, which carried the answer to the demand
of the rustlers, and that most concerned the men,
had just come in, and its message was a subject of
discussion. One ruffian was of the opinion that
either Bindloss or the Overlanders were trying to
play a sharp trick on them and search out their
hiding place. He was laughed at.</p>

<p>“How kin anybody foller er bird flyin’ high?”
demanded another, whereat the ruffians laughed
more uproariously than before. The feel of the
money that the pigeons had brought, outweighed
their caution. This was easy money, and there
was more of it coming.</p>

<p>“We’ll git all we kin fer this feller, an’ then
make a price on t’other feller’s haid, an’ we’ll make
er clean-up,” chuckled another. “It ain’t the
first time thet them birds has done us a good turn,
but never jest in this heah way.”</p>

<p>At the mention of another captive on whose
head a price was to be set, the fat boy pricked
up his ears. He wondered whom else the ruffians
had captured, and where the other captive was
being held. This was interesting, but what
followed was more so.</p>

<p>From the talk Stacy overheard he learned that,
after the ruffians had gotten all the money they
could out of the Overlanders, the prisoners were
to be disposed of.</p>

<p>“They knows too much to let ’em git away,
especially thet fat feller. He’s too fresh anyway,”
averred one.</p>

<p>“Best way is to take ’em out on a dark night,
turn ’em ’round a few times and head ’em fer the
canyon, an’ tell ’em to git home a-whooping.
Ain’t no need fer us to do nothing more’n thet.
They’ll do the rest,” advised another.</p>

<p>“Thet’s the ticket, Charlie!” complimented
another. “We’ll make ’em walk the plank, an’
the buzzards’ll do the rest.” The ruffians roared.
It would be great sport and it would make disposal
of their captives a most simple matter.</p>

<p>Stacy Brown did not laugh. Instead, he
swallowed hard, and a heavy frown wrinkled his
forehead.</p>

<p>“That’s what I call a low-down trick,” he
muttered. “Going to get all the money they can
for me and the other fellow and then send us
out to walk on air. Wow! Stacy Brown, I reckon
it’s time for you to leave.” He gazed out through
the open door of the lean-to and contemplated
the possibility of rolling out and trying to escape.
That did not seem to be feasible, so he pondered,
strained cautiously at the ropes with which he was
tied, and decided that he must think of something
else.</p>

<p>“If I could get hold of a hunting knife I might
manage it,” he thought, but did not recall having
seen any such thing among the assortment of
equipment in the lean-to. Then an idea occurred
to him.</p>

<p>“The axe!” exclaimed the fat boy, and instantly
began rolling towards the door, just outside
of which he had seen an axe that very day.
He found the axe and after several failures Stacy
succeeded in getting it between his knees blade
up, and began sawing at the rope that bound his
wrists. The rope soon fell apart. Stacy could
scarcely repress a howl of delight. It was now
the work of only a moment to free his legs, and
the Overland boy, still clinging to the axe as a
weapon in case of discovery, began considering
his next move. He knew about where the ruffians’
ponies were tethered, because he had heard
them stamping many times.</p>

<p>“Now, if I had a gun I’d be—Sure I have!”
He felt along the rear wall of the lean-to, where
among saddles and bridles hung holsters with
weapons in them, and ammunition belts, and
rifles of quite modern pattern hanging from nails
in the wall.</p>

<p>The fat boy quickly helped himself to two
revolvers and a rifle, each of which he found
loaded. That gave him fresh courage. He might
be surprised, but it was his idea that the other
fellow might be more so. Stacy, armed and eager,
crept from the lean-to and picked his way
cautiously towards the spot at the base of the
granite slope where he hoped to find the rustlers’
horses tethered. They were not there, but he
found them about a hundred yards to the left,
all saddled and bridled, ready for instant use in
case of need.</p>

<p>There appeared to be no one on guard, but,
though he did not know it, two men were stationed
a short distance from the cabin on the
Coso Valley side of the mountain hiding place.
Fortunately for him, the fat boy was on the other
side.</p>

<p>Stacy selected a mount, and, finding a rifle in
the saddle boot, he threw away the one he had
taken from the lean-to.</p>

<p>“I wish I dared to shoot up that place,” he
muttered, gazing off towards the cabin which he
could not now see. “I’ll come back and do it.”</p>

<p>Stacy led the mustang along carefully for a
while, taking what he believed to be an easterly
course, and getting his bearings from the stars so
that he might not travel in a circle and bring up
at his starting point.</p>

<p>There appearing to be no pursuit, the boy finally
mounted and rode away with increasing speed
and rising spirits. He continued on until towards
daylight when he found himself descending into
what he believed to be foothills, but which proved
to be grazing grounds in the mountains. They
were of vast extent, covering many acres, and over
this mesa Stacy wandered for hours trying to find
a way out. He was hungry, ravenously so now,
and a search of the saddle-bags revealed not even
a biscuit.</p>

<p>Noon came and, well-nigh famished, he turned
the mustang into the chaparral determined to
find a new trail. The boy had gone in but a short
distance when he began to sniff the air. Even the
mustang lifted its head and snorted.</p>

<p>“If that isn’t food smoke I never smelled any.
Stacy Brown, follow your nose, for your nose
knows. Gid-ap, you lazy lout!” he cried.</p>

<p>Perhaps the pony really knew, for it pricked
up its ears with new interest and seemed eager
to go on, and a few moments later Stacy discovered
a shack ahead. The smoke odor was
by now quite strong.</p>

<p>The boy approached the shack with caution,
and rode twice around it before deciding to hail.
When he finally did so there was no answer, so
he dismounted and entered.</p>

<p>What he had come upon was a chuck-house
where mountain herders got their meals.</p>

<p>That a meal had quite recently been eaten there
was evidenced by the soiled dishes still on the
table, and the food that was simmering in frying
pans on the stove.</p>

<p>“Eats! I don’t know who it belongs to, but
I know when I am hungry,” cried Stacy, helping
himself to several slices of bacon from a frying
pan and eating them out of his hand. There was
bread, too, and coffee in the pots. Stacy tasted
the coffee and made a wry face.</p>

<p>“Worse than the rustlers made,” he complained.</p>

<p>Had the Overland Rider not been so fully occupied
with satisfying his hunger, he probably would
have been more observant. As it was he did not
see a horseman ride up, dismount and peer into
the shack. Nor did he see the fellow’s expression
when he looked over Stacy’s mount. The newcomer
rode away quietly to a distance and then
put his pony to a run.</p>

<p>Half an hour later while the boy was still
eating, and just as he was about to place a biscuit
in his mouth, a voice out of the silence
arrested him.</p>

<p>“Put up yer hands, young feller! I’ve got ye
covered,” warned the voice.</p>

<p>The hand that held the biscuit was already
raised to a level with his mouth, and the other
promptly went above his head.</p>

<p>“Turn around, an’ let’s git a look at ye!”</p>

<p>Stacy turned and found himself facing a weapon
in the hands of a man at the door. Just to the
rear of the man with the gun were half a dozen
others.</p>

<p>“Tough-lookin’ critter, all right. Who be ye?”
demanded the hold-up man.</p>

<p>“Name’s Brown,” answered the fat boy, transferring
the biscuit to his mouth and beginning
to chew on it.</p>

<p>“Whar’d ye git that cayuse?”</p>

<p>“Maybe I stole him,” answered Chunky
thickly, for the biscuit was large. “What difference
does it make to you where I got him?”</p>

<p>“It may make a lot of difference to ye, young
feller. I reckon mebby ye knows thet thet critter
belongs to the Diamond Bar ranch, an’ thet he
was stole from thar three days ago. Turn round
while I relieve ye of some of thet hardware.”</p>

<p>Stacy ceased chewing and stood with arms uplifted
while his weapons and cartridge belt were
being removed, following which he was roughly
yanked around facing his captors.</p>

<p>“You be careful, you rough-necks. You’ll find
out that I’m a bad man when I get riled,” warned
Chunky boastfully.</p>

<p>“I reckon ye be all of thet. Jest now ye ain’t,
an’ ’fore long mebby ye won’t be nothin’ ’tall.
Yer under arrest!” announced the spokesman.</p>

<p>“Wha—at for?” gasped the Overland boy, his
face losing some of its color.</p>

<p>“Horse stealin’! Thet’s all!”</p>

<p>A strong hand was fastened on Stacy’s collar
and he was roughly jerked out of the cabin and
thrown on the pony that he was accused of having
rustled. It began to dawn on Stacy Brown that
he was in a serious predicament.</p>

<span>CHAPTER XVIII</span><br />
<span>TROUBLE AT RED GULCH</span>
</h2>

<p>The second bird was liberated at noon,
and was quickly on its way, observed
eagerly by the girls of the Overland unit
and their companions of the Circle O ranch. The
pigeon did not seem to deviate a hair’s breadth
from the line followed by the first bird.</p>

<p>“Isn’t it wonderful to be a bird and go where
the wind listeth?” murmured Emma Dean.</p>

<p>“It would be, but they don’t,” answered Miss
Briggs laughingly. “Wind is the pigeon’s enemy
and unless it is with them they have to fight it,
and in doing so are frequently lost. I happen
to know some things about carrier pigeons, for
I have seen them work and heard much about
them in France. Once a pigeon becomes lost and
has to come down, he loses his ambition, or his
confidence, or something—at least something
seems to have gone out of him, and, even if he
returns at all, he seldom can be depended upon
to make another flight. I venture to say that
not all the birds we are sending out will reach
their loft.”</p>

<p>“So long as the boys see the majority of them
we do not care,” said Nora. “Oh, I hope they
do.”</p>

<p>The boys did—that is, Hippy, Sam and Pete
saw the second bird going over and watched it
until it flew out of sight. Now they knew that
they were on the right trail. The five o’clock bird
was the last one seen by any of the men, and it
was Lieutenant Wingate who discovered it. The
bird was flying so low that it seemed to be skimming
the tops of the slender mountain pines.
Observing this Hippy hurried on to join Sam
Conifer, whom he found in about half an hour.</p>

<p>“Go easy from now on, Sam,” he cautioned.</p>

<p>“You know somethin’?” demanded the guide.</p>

<p>“The bird that just went over was flying very
low. That indicates that he has located his cote
and is reaching for it. I do not believe it can
be more than a mile or two away from here.
Shall I take the lead now?”</p>

<p>“No! I’ll take it myself,” snapped the guide.
Sam was irritable, but Hippy laid it to the guide’s
wound and his weakened condition. As a matter
of fact it was neither. Sam’s nerves were on edge
and his rheumatic fingers were “crinkling,” for he
could almost feel the feel of a gun in his right
hand.</p>

<p>“Very well. I shall keep up close to you, just
the same,” announced Hippy. “If you come
upon something you’ll need assistance. The men
at the rear are instructed not to shoot until they
are positive about what they are shooting at, so
there is not much danger of their firing at us.”</p>

<p>Sam answered with a grunt and started on.
Half an hour later he halted to wait for his companion
to come up to him.</p>

<p>“What is it?” whispered Hippy.</p>

<p>“I got er whiff o’ smoke. Mebby it’s the
makin’s o’ a forest fire, an’ mebby ’tain’t. We’ll
leave the ponies heah an’ go on afoot. Ye better
wait an’ tell ’em so they don’t blunder on an’
spoil the game.”</p>

<p>The “game”! What a game it was, a game
of life and death, thought Lieutenant Hippy Wingate,
as he tethered the mustangs at one side of
the trail and sat down to rest and wait.</p>

<p>It was about this time that Stacy Brown was
taking his departure from the cabin of the mountain
ruffians, not dreaming that a friend was so
near at hand. In the meantime Sam had begun
moving forward slowly, making scarcely a sound,
so light were his footsteps, the right hand nervously
twitching over the protruding butt of his
revolver.</p>

<p>The guide brought up sharply with his whiskers
standing out at an angle, and listened attentively.
He had heard a human laugh, and Sam knew
quite well that it could not be behind him, for
his companions were not in a laughing mood that
evening. He picked his way forward a little
farther and again halted and listened.</p>

<p>A shout startled him and his muscles tensed.
It was a shout of anger, at first sounding as though
from a distance, then all at once near at hand.
Stacy Brown’s escape had been discovered, and
the mountain ruffians were running about in
search of him, but by this time the boy was some
distance away. When it was discovered that one
of the ponies was missing the rage of the rustlers
knew no restraint, and each was seeking for an
excuse to place the responsibility on his companions.</p>

<p>“Somethin’ goin’ on over thar, but I’m dad-busted
if I knows what it’s all ’bout,” muttered
Sam.</p>

<p>Two shots rang out almost as one, and the old
gunman knew what that meant. Two rustlers
had fired, but one had been a fraction of a second
quicker than the other, and one probably was out
of the fight, for there were no more shots, and
the voices of the rustlers became more subdued.</p>

<p>Sam Conifer moved up a little closer. Lieutenant
Wingate, too, had heard the shots and was
growing restless, but dared not leave his position
until Tom, Two-Gun and Idaho came up.</p>

<p>By this time Conifer had discovered the cabin.
Fortunately for his purposes, all the rustlers were
now in the cabin excitedly discussing the escape
of their prisoner, and considering what they had
better do. It was the opinion of the wiser ones
that Brown never would be able to find the place
again, which was probably true, and that the
other prisoner was still in their possession. It
was decided, therefore, to keep a sharp lookout
and collect all the money from the Overlanders
that they possibly could, then dispose of the man
they still held. It would not do to let that man
get away.</p>

<p>As it developed later the two rustlers who had
shot at each other had missed, whereupon their
companions intervened and peace was restored,
as Sam Conifer learned a few moments later
from such snatches of conversation as he could
catch.</p>

<p>The old guide crept up the granite slope a noiseless
shadow, and as he neared the open door of
the cabin he crouched with every faculty on the
alert, his right hand twitching, eyes slowly searching
the faces of the men under the light of a
lantern swinging from a beam in the center of
the room. Sam raised himself erect and glided
noiselessly to the door. There he stood for a full
minute, his gaze shifting from one to another of
the men gathered there and finally coming to rest
on the dark, swarthy face of one who looked to
be a Mexican, and whose attitude and peremptory
speech plainly showed that he was the leader of
the party.</p>

<p>“I’ve been thinkin’. The boy’ll be home
prob’ly some time in the morning, but he can’t
be ’lowed to git thar. We’ve got to put a man
on his trail with a light, bad as it be to do thet,
an’ run him down afore he gits thar. Bad-Eye,
it’s up to you to do the job, an’ if ye do it right,
the boy’ll be a dead dude by mornin’. If he ain’t
I’ll go git him myself, fer he ain’t no good.”</p>

<p>“I reckon ye lie!”</p>

<p>It was a thunderbolt, hurled at them by Sam
Conifer from the doorway, and half a dozen hands
flew to as many revolver holsters.</p>

<p>“Put ’em back!”</p>

<p>The command was uttered with an incisiveness
that cut like a keen-edged blade, and the hands
of the mountain ruffians sagged away from their
holsters ever so little.</p>

<p>“I’ve got somethin’ to say to ye cayuses fust.
After I gits finished ye kin shoot. Ye’r a fine
bunch of mavericks, ain’t ye?” drawled Sam.</p>
</div>

<h2 id='chXIX' title='XIX: A DUEL IN THE DARK'>
<span>CHAPTER XIX</span><br />
<span>A DUEL IN THE DARK</span>
</h2>

<p>Ordinarily long before this every gun
in the room would have been trained
on the intruder, but something restrained
them. Perhaps it was the easy, confident
manner of the man in the doorway. Then
again, they well knew that a man who would
voluntarily face that assemblage, and expect to
get away with it, must have supreme confidence
in himself. Whether or not that confidence was
well placed, they proposed to find out sooner or
later.</p>

<p>“I been lookin’ fer ye fellers,” announced Sam.
“Now that I’ve found ye we’ll have a little confab,
so don’t git smart an’ feel fer yer guns, ’cause
somethin’ might happen. This heah right hand
o’ mine, though it’s all crinkled up with the
rheumatiz, now an’ ag’in gits mighty nervous, an’
it might throw a gun afore I could stop it. Jest
like this”:</p>

<p>His heavy Colt revolver flicked into Sam Conifer’s
hand as if by magic, and lay trembling there
in his palm. Then it slipped smoothly towards
his finger tips as if doing so of its own volition,
spun and slid without an apparent movement of
the arm, always moving, now like a flash of light,
then with slow easy grace, but, as it was observed
by the keen eyes of the watchers, with the
muzzle ever pointed towards him of the swarthy
face.</p>

<p>As the weapon slipped back into its holster, and
the rheumatic hand of the old guide lay trembling
on its butt, a look of relief passed over the
face of the dark mountaineer.</p>

<p>The others in the cabin looked their amazement,
for few there had ever seen a gun handled
as this old, stoop-shouldered intruder handled his.
It was a revelation, though not a pleasant
one. It was a warning as well, but they were
watching him—watching and waiting for that
moment when the old man’s alert, shifting glances
should wander from some of them for a few
golden seconds.</p>

<p>“Say, ye feller! Who be ye?” demanded the
dark man. “What do ye mean by holdin’ up
a bunch o’ honest prospectors?”</p>

<p>Sam Conifer grinned sardonically.</p>

<p>“Honest, did ye say? You don’t know the
meanin’ o’ that word. Them’s queer words comin’
from the lips o’ Mexican Charlie.”</p>

<p>The dark man started, flushed and reached for
his weapon, but thinking better of it, permitted
his hand to slip back to its former position.</p>

<p>“I wants to know whar the boy is? Mex, I
ask ye, whar is he?”</p>

<p>“I don’t know.”</p>

<p>“Ye lie, Mex! Yer too yellow to draw at thet
word. Whar’s my pard, Jim?”</p>

<p>“I tell you I don’t know nothin’ ’bout what yer
talkin’,” flung back Mexican Charlie.</p>

<p>“Ye lie twice, but yer too yellow to draw at
thet word,” reiterated Sam. “I knows thet the
boy got away, but whar did he go?”</p>

<p>“Don’t know nothin’ ’bout it. Who be ye?”</p>

<p>“Leavin’ the lie fer the moment, ye ought to
know me, Charlie. You an’ me has met afore,
but a long time ago an’ times has changed me,
but yer the same low-down houn’ thet ye always
was. I’ve growed some fresh whiskers since ye
last seen me, an’ fer reasons. Look sharp, Mex!
Look under the whiskers and mebby ye’ll see a
scar thar,” urged the old guide, lifting his whiskers
with the left hand. “Do ye see it, Mex?”</p>

<p>The mountaineer nodded, but he was puzzled.
That scar seemed to bring back the past, but
Mexican Charlie plainly could not fix the thing
in his mind.</p>

<p>“Mex! Ye put thet scar thar. It was up in
the Klondike years ago, and ye give it to me when
I wasn’t lookin’. Ye got away then an’ ye know
why, cause my hand wasn’t all crinkled up with
the rheumatiz like it is now. But listen, Mex!
I’ve been waitin’ fer ye, knowin’ thet some day
you an’ me would meet up with each other an’
then we’d talk it all over nice an’ friendly like.
I didn’t recognize ye when ye come to our camp
t’other night an’ told us ye come from Malcolm
Hornby with orders fer us to git out ’cause we was
on his property. Ye lied then, too, jest as you’ve
been doin’ tonight. Mex, I’m Sam Conifer!”</p>

<p>The announcement was like a blow in the face
to Mexican Charlie. Mex knew his torturer now.
To the others the announcement meant nothing
except as they saw how nervous it had made their
leader.</p>

<p>“Do ye know what I’m goin’ to do now, Mex?”
purred Sam.</p>

<p>“Yer goin’ to git out o’ here afore somebody
shoots ye up!” shouted the mountaineer.</p>

<p>“Shore I be, but not yit. Fust, I’m goin’ to
give ye the same kind o’ scar that ye give me up
in the Klondike. Turn yer head round sideways
jest as I was doin’ when ye give it to me,” urged
Sam gently.</p>

<p>“Yer wrong, pard. I ain’t the man ye think
I be. I never seen ye before,” protested Charlie.</p>

<p>“I’m speakin’ to ye, Charlie! Be ye goin’
to turn yer head or must I turn it fer ye after
I’ve put ye in condition to turn?”</p>

<p>“I’ll kill ye fer this!” hissed the mountaineer.
“Yer a coward, an’ ye wouldn’t dare talk to me
like thet if things was equal.</p>

<p>“No, things ain’t equal, eh? Heah ye be, six
of ye an’ I only one man; each of ye armed an’
lookin’ fer a chance to kill me, but not darin’ to
try it, though I ain’t got a gun in my hand no
more than ye fellers has. No, things ain’t equal.
Draw, ye sneakin’ coyote! I’ll not touch my gun
till your’n is out o’ the holster. Draw, you
coward!”</p>

<p>Enraged beyond further endurance, and taking
advantage of the visitor’s apparent relaxation,
Mexican Charlie snatched at his gun, fumbled it
in his nervous excitement, then jerked it free.</p>

<p>Like a flash of light the nervous hand of Sam
Conifer flicked his own weapon out and two guns
roared, one a fraction of a second ahead of the
other. Mexican Charlie clapped a hand to his
neck, as his weapon fell to the floor.</p>

<p>“Steady, fellers! We ain’t finished our little
talk yit,” warned Sam. “Mex’s got it right whar
he give it to me an’ he don’t like it. Neither
did I. Tie yer handkerchief ’bout yer neck,
Charlie, an’ we’ll finish what we got to say to
each other, an’ this time ye’ll talk right out in
meetin’ cause thar’s some things I’ve got to know,
among them, who is bossin’ this heah gang o’
rustlers, an’ hoss thieves, an’ fellers thet—”</p>

<p>Sam did not finish his sentence. A rifle somewhere
outside of the cabin roared, and the lantern
swinging overhead crashed to the floor, leaving
the room in sudden darkness.</p>

<p>Revolvers began to bark, weapons aimed at the
spot where Sam Conifer had been standing. The
firing was fast and furious for a moment, then
the voice of Mexican Charlie was heard above the
uproar.</p>

<p>“Git out! On the jump!” he shouted.</p>

<p>The rustlers made haste to obey, some going
out by way of the door, others taking to the rear
and out by the lean-to in which Stacy Brown
had been held a captive.</p>

<p>A moment later Sam Conifer rose from the
floor where he had thrown himself on the instant
when the light went out, and stole out. Sam
did not go far, only to the base of the granite
slope, at one side of which he crouched down and
waited. Sam could not understand that shot.
Why, if it were a friend of the rustlers, did the
fellow not shoot him instead of shooting out the
light? After a time a light began to dawn on the
old guide. He uttered a low whistle signal that
had been agreed upon between himself and his
companions.</p>

<p>The signal was properly answered.</p>

<p>“Come heah, but do it keerful like,” ordered
Conifer.</p>

<p>After a few seconds a voice called out softly.
It was the voice of Two-gun Pete.</p>

<p>“Thet you, Sam?” asked Pete.</p>

<p>“Yes. Whar’s that bunch o’ ruffians?” demanded
the guide.</p>

<p>“They’ve hit the trail on their ponies, an’
some of ’em had to be helped into their saddles,
I reckon. Our fellers aire back heah in the bushes.
They was waitin’ till I sized things up an’—”</p>

<p>“Look heah, Pete! Be you the critter thet
shot out the light jest when I was holdin’ a
friendly conversation with thet bunch? Be you
him?”</p>

<p>Pete admitted that he was the man.</p>

<p>“Thar was a feller in thar thet had his gun
out and was gittin’ ready to let you have it,”
explained Pete. “I reckoned thet I didn’t want
to kill the critter. Somehow I don’t like to let
go at a feller when he ain’t lookin’. It ain’t good
sport; so I jest shot out the light, knowin’ thet
you’d be out of range instanter if things went off
thar, which they did.”</p>

<p>“Thet’s what I calls a low-down trick, Pete.
No gent would butt in when another gent is
holdin’ a private conversation, but I forgive ye.
Lead me to our bunch. Be they all heah?”</p>

<p>Pete said they were, and conducted Sam to
them. Tom, Hippy and Idaho eagerly plied the
old guide with questions, all talking at the same
time. They conversed in low tones, for no one
knew at what moment they might be overheard
by mountain prowlers, for none had great faith
in the flight of the men that Sam Conifer had
held up. They were expected to return seeking
for revenge.</p>

<p>Sam was troubled, though the Overlanders were
happy in the thought that Stacy had escaped.
They reasoned that by this time he must be well
on his way to the Circle O ranch. Sam, on the
other hand, was worried about Jim. He believed
that Jim must be somewhere about, and, after a
few moments’ further conversation with his companions,
started for a prowl about. In the meantime
Two-gun and Idaho kept watch to guard
against surprises.</p>

<p>The old guide’s search lasted for more than an
hour. Upon his return he announced that he
couldn’t find the slightest trace of Jim, and that
he could do nothing more until daylight. The
night passed without the party being disturbed,
and with daylight all hands were out before breakfast
continuing the search.</p>

<p>The cabin was the first object of their inquiry.
After searching it and finding nothing of interest,
except the message that Hippy had sent by one
of the pigeons, they proceeded to the lean-to.
The first object to interest them there was Stacy
Brown’s hat.</p>

<p>“I reckon the fat boy went away in a hurry,”
suggested Pete.</p>

<p>“An’ somebody cut the ropes thet held him,”
added Idaho.</p>

<p>“He cut ’em hisself with the axe,” averred
Sam, whose eyes had taken in every detail in one
sweeping glance. “I knowed the kid would fool
’em if he got half a chance. But whar’s Jim? If
they’ve done fer him I’ll foller thet bunch till
I gits every one of ’em, if it takes me all the rest
of my life. But Jim ain’t daid. I’ll tell ye, Cap’n
Gray, and all the rest of ye, I love thet pard o’
mine like I never didn’t love no one else.”</p>

<p>“Then why do you fight each other all the
time?” questioned Hippy laughingly.</p>

<p>“Why, ain’t thet the way? What t’other way
could a couple of fellers show thet they love each
other? Ye wouldn’t expect ’em to git mushy,
would ye? No. Ain’t no t’other way ’cept to
arg’fy an’ fit it out. Why, Jim an’ me have got
so het up now an’ ag’in thet we drawed guns on
each other, an’ one time Jim shot at me, but
thet critter never could shoot. All he kin do is
to foller a trail, but thar ain’t a man lives thet
kin beat him at thet. The time he shot at me, I
was so all-fired tickled to think I’d riled him till
he drawed, thet I jest chucked my gun an’ grabbed
him an’ hugged him till we both got to laughin’.
Thet’s the only time we ever come nigh gittin’
mushy like a couple o’ gals,” finished Conifer, who
stroking his whiskers, turned and strode out to
the edge of the gulch that dropped away at the
rear of the lean-to.</p>

<p>Hippy looked at Tom and Tom looked at
Hippy, then both burst into laughter.</p>

<p>“Can you beat it?” chuckled Hippy.</p>

<p>Tom Gray agreed that he could not. Sam was
out of range of both their words or their laughter,
absorbed in his study of the surrounding mountains
and gorges. His forehead wore a heavy
frown, and, as he looked he thought, with all the
concentration that he could summon, trying to
evolve a theory to find a solution of the mystery
of his companion’s disappearance. No answer
came to him.</p>

<p>Two-gun Pete, who was listening to the conversation
of the two Overland men, suddenly
reared his head attentively.</p>

<p>“Did ye hear it?” he demanded.</p>

<p>The Overlanders nodded. The distant report of
a rifle had been heard by all, but as there was
no repetition of it they again fell to talking.</p>

<p>“Wha—at!” cried Lieutenant Wingate,
springing to his feet when, a moment later, Sam
Conifer came staggering in. “In the name of
Mike, what’s happened?”</p>

<p>The old guide’s face was covered with blood
from the forehead down, which served to
accentuate the pallor that showed in the narrow strip
above it.</p>

<p>“Sam! What is it?” begged Tom Gray.</p>

<p>“Nothin’ much ’cept—” The words ended in
a moan, and old Sam Conifer, staggering forward
a pace, crumpled down to the floor and lay still.</p>

<span>CHAPTER XX</span><br />
<span>STACY WIELDS A CLUB</span>
</h2>

<p>Stacy Brown’s face wore a serious expression
as his captors started away with
him. His pony was free, but there were
men ahead of and behind him, men whose faces
were stern and threatening. The rifle had been
taken from the boot of his saddle and his revolvers
were gone. He was as helpless as a child, but the
fat boy was watching for an opportunity to escape.</p>

<p>“Where are you taking me?” he demanded
after they had galloped on for the better part of
an hour.</p>

<p>“You’ll see when you git thar,” was the brief
reply.</p>

<p>“You don’t say,” retorted Chunky, whereupon
he was ordered to keep silent.</p>

<p>Soon after that a collection of ranch buildings
was seen nestling below in the foothills, which
were regarded with interest by the Overland boy
as his captors headed for them. As they neared
the ranch, a few men appeared and with shaded
eyes watched the approach. When the captors
finally pulled up before the ranch, a thin, tall,
bronzed man came out and bent a keen gaze on
Chunky.</p>

<p>“What have you got heah?” he demanded.</p>

<p>“Feller we caught with the mustang thet was
stolen the other night,” replied one of the captors.</p>

<p>“So? A hoss thief, eh?”</p>

<p>“I’m not!” objected the fat boy indignantly.</p>

<p>“So? Mebby he is your horse, eh?”</p>

<p>Stacy admitted that it was not his horse.</p>

<p>“Where did you get him?” snapped the
rancher.</p>

<p>“I helped myself to him—took him because
I wanted to get away from a bunch of ruffians.”</p>

<p>“Where was that?”</p>

<p>Stacy said he didn’t know, but that it was in the
mountains on the edge of a red gulch, and further
admitted that he didn’t know much about the
country there and would feel fully as well satisfied
if he didn’t know as much as he did.</p>

<p>“What’s your name?”</p>

<p>“Name’s Brown. What’s yours?”</p>

<p>“I am William Crawley, the owner of this
ranch, and the pony you are on is my property.
I don’t suppose there is any use in questioning
you, for a fellow who will rustle horses will lie
as well as steal. I’ll hear what you have to say,
however.”</p>

<p>“If you don’t mind, suppose you untie me and
let me get down. I don’t like to be hung up this
way ’cause it gets tiresome.”</p>

<p>“I reckon you will have plenty of time to rest,
young fellow,” answered the rancher, grinning
sardonically. “Let him down. Has he guns on
him?”</p>

<p>A member of the party said that they had taken
his weapons from the boy, and explained in detail
how they happened to discover him helping himself
to food in the chuck-house up on the range,
to all of which Rancher Crawley listened attentively.
He turned to Stacy again.</p>

<p>“Tell me what you wish about yourself and
I’ll listen,” he said.</p>

<p>“What’s the use? You won’t believe me,”
protested Stacy.</p>

<p>“As you wish. It doesn’t make much difference
what you say. You will have to tell your story
to the sheriff at Carrago, for we’re going to send
a man for him today.”</p>

<p>“I belong to the Overland Riders. We ride
somewhere every summer,” began Stacy hurriedly.
“This summer we chose the Bad Lands in the
Cosos, but I reckon that, had we known how bad
they are, we should have stayed away. We have
been hanging out with Joe Bindloss, and the rest
of my party is over there now. We have a camp
pitched just back of his house where the garden
ought to be, but isn’t.”</p>

<p>“How about it, Skip?” interrupted the rancher,
turning to one of his men. “You was over there
this morning.”</p>

<p>The man replied that there was no camp back
of Bindloss’s house, and that, further, no one was
there when he dropped in.</p>

<p>Bill Crawley smiled sarcastically.</p>

<p>“You see! A hoss thief can’t tell the truth,”
he reiterated.</p>

<p>“Neither can some other people,” flung back
Chunky heatedly. “I’m telling you the truth,
and I don’t care whether you believe me or not,
but if you are half so smart as you think you are
you will know that I am telling no lies. I don’t
have to be a horse thief. I’ve got money, I’d
have you know.”</p>

<p>“Most hoss thieves have,” agreed one of the
cowpunchers. “What were you doing in the
mountains alone?”</p>

<p>Stacy, though weary and out of patience with
all this, explained that while out with Bindloss’s
men on the round-up, he was roped and carried
into the mountains where he was held prisoner
while a gang of rustlers tried to get his companions
to pay a ransom for him. He told about
the carrier pigeons, and the money that the ruffians
had collected by means of the birds. As he
talked the grins on the faces of the cowpunchers
grew broader. They had never heard a fairy tale
quite so ingenious. Bill Crawley’s face wore an
expression of weariness.</p>

<p>“Young fellow, I’ve heard some liars in my
time, but you win!” he declared. “Take him
over to the hay barn and lock him in. If he tries
to get out, shoot him!”</p>

<p>“If you were alone with me you wouldn’t
dare say that, you bluffer!” retorted Chunky, his
cheeks flushing with anger.</p>

<p>“What’s that you say?” demanded the rancher,
taking a step toward the boy, his chin thrust out
belligerently.</p>

<p>“Oh, nothing much,” muttered Stacy. “I
reckon I was talking in my sleep.”</p>

<p>“Lock him up. And, Skip! Get a bite to eat,
then hit the trail for Carrago. You ought to get
back some time tomorrow forenoon, but bring the
sheriff with you. We’ve got one of the rustlers
that have been stealing stock from us this
summer, and, young fellow, we’re going to send
you to jail. You’re lucky that you aren’t shot!”
was Crawley’s parting word.</p>

<p>Stacy was yanked nearly off his feet by a
cowpuncher and hauled protesting to the barn, a
structure that was built with the idea of keeping
thieves from stealing from it. He was thrown
violently to the floor as his jailer hurled him into
the place, and the door was slammed behind him
and locked.</p>

<p>There were tears of anger in the eyes of the fat
boy as he sat up and rubbed himself.</p>

<p>“I wish I had a gun! Oh, I wish I had a gun!”
he raged.</p>

<p>After the peak of his rage had been passed,
Stacy began to take account of his surroundings.
On either side of him were huge mows of hay
already laid up for the stock that would have to be
wintered on the ranch, but finally, weariness overcoming
him, the Overland boy stretched out on
the barn floor and went to sleep. He did not
awaken until twilight when a boot, coming into
violent contact with his person, brought him up,
once more in a belligerent mood.</p>

<p>“Heah’s yer chuck,” announced the cowpuncher.
“I hope it chokes ye!” added the man,
backing out and locking the door.</p>

<p>The sight of food made Stacy forget his troubles
for the time being, and he helped himself freely
of the liberal meal. Upon second thought, the boy
stowed part of the food in his pockets, thinking
it might be useful later on, for he had hopes of
making his escape.</p>

<p>After finishing his meal he climbed the ladder
to the top of the hay loft and floundered about
in the faint light for some time, hoping to find
a window. There was none. Getting down, he
tried the mow on the other side of the barn, but
with no better results, whereupon Chunky returned
to the floor and sat down, head in hands.</p>

<p>“Tomorrow, if I am here, I’ll be on my way to
jail,” he reflected. “Of course it will all come
out right. They won’t keep me there long, but
I don’t like the idea of going to jail when there
is so much going on over in the valley. Besides,
a fellow doesn’t get very good food in these
western jails, so I’ve heard. I’ve got to get out
of here. That’s flat!”</p>

<p>The Overland boy got up and leaned against the
hay wagon that stood on the barn floor. One
hand came in contact with one of the pins, oak
pins about a yard long, that keep the hay on the
rack when loading. He pulled the pin out and
felt over its entire length. It was smooth, worn
so from long usage, and the feel of it was good
to Stacy Brown. It was something that might
be used for a weapon as well as a tool. With
it he tried to pry open the barn door, but the
door would not budge. Once more the fat boy
was at the end of his resources, but as he stood
leaning against the door, he heard some one fussing
with the lock.</p>

<p>Stacy was instantly on the alert as some one
opened the door.</p>

<p>“Hey, ye hoss thief! Whar be ye? The
boss reckons as I’d better start for Carrago with
ye now so as to git thar in the mornin’ an’ git
back in good season.”</p>

<p>“All right,” replied the lad, yawning.</p>

<p>“What you doin’ heah by the door?” demanded
the man.</p>

<p>“Maybe I was trying to get out. What?”
laughed the fat boy.</p>

<p>“I don’t reckon as you’ll be gittin’ out till ye
go with me, an’ don’t ye try any monkeyshines,
’cause I’ve got er gun in my hand an’ I’ll use it
on ye, ye cheap rustler. Git ’round in front of
me whar I kin see ye!”</p>

<p>“I’ll bet you I get away,” answered Chunky,
“and I’ll have the law on this outfit for what
it has done to me!”</p>

<p>Whack! He brought the oak stick down on the
head of the cowpuncher.</p>

<p>The fellow went down in a heap, whereupon
Stacy Brown stepped out, closed and locked the
door behind him and walked calmly away.</p>

<p>“When I get riled I’m a pretty bad man,”
admitted the Overland boy, chuckling to himself.</p>

<span>CHAPTER XXI</span><br />
<span>JUDY BRINGS TIDINGS</span>
</h2>

<p>At first the two Overland Riders in the
mountain cabin thought Sam Conifer had
been mortally wounded, but after they
had pulled themselves together, washed his face
and examined his wound, they decided that it
might not be so serious after all. A bullet had
laid about four inches of the forehead open, but
did not seem to have done the skull injury.</p>

<p>Sam was placed on blankets in the cabin, and
the two Overlanders worked over him until he
regained consciousness. While they were doing
this Two-gun Pete and Idaho, rifles in hands,
skulked about outside, trying to discover the man
who had fired the shot that got Sam. Not knowing
what position the old guide was standing in
when hit, they were unable to determine the
direction from which the bullet had come, and
were about to return to the cabin to see if Sam
had come to, when Pete uttered a yell.</p>

<p>“Git down!” he shouted.</p>

<p>At the same instant, Idaho heard the report of
a rifle and threw himself down. Pete was already
on the ground, hat in hand, and looking at it
ruefully. He held it up for his companion to see.</p>

<p>“Put er hole plumb through it,” he growled.
“Thet miserable cayuse! I hope I git a squint
at him over the sights of my rifle. But, man,
he shore kin shoot!”</p>

<p>“Whar do ye think it come from?” asked
Idaho Jones.</p>

<p>“From t’other side of the gulch. Must be
usin’ a telescope rifle, for no man with open sights
could make two shots like thet. He might do
it once, but not twice. I call thet some shootin’.
No wonder he got old Sam. Ye keep watch. I’m
going in to tell the Dude an’ Cap’n Gray ’bout
this heah,” announced Pete, making a run for the
protection of the rocks about the cabin.</p>

<p>He found Sam awake. The Overlanders had
heard the shot, and met Pete with a quick inquiry
about it. Two-gun Pete exhibited his hat as the
answer to their question.</p>

<p>“I come in to ask ’bout Sam. I reckoned as
mebby you’d like to have somebody go down to
the valley an’ git help fer him.”</p>

<p>“Not unless you wish to get away from here,
which I don’t believe you do,” replied Tom Gray.</p>

<p>“I reckon I don’t—not onless it’s to save a
pard’s life. Is he bad off—goin’ to pass in?”</p>

<p>“No, I ain’t, you miserable galoot!” answered
Sam Conifer heatedly. “I’m goin’ out purty soon
to hunt fer a man, an’ when I finds him—”</p>

<p>“Not today, Samuel,” differed Hippy.</p>

<p>“I be!” insisted the injured man.</p>

<p>“I reckon what the Boss says goes ’round
heah,” reminded Two-gun Pete. “I’ll git out
an’ keep watch.”</p>

<p>Soon after that Conifer, his head bandaged up
as best the two men could do it, went to sleep,
and the Overlanders fell to considering what they
ought to do. They decided, in the first place,
that Idaho and Pete should go out and make
further search for Jim, following the direction
taken by the outlaws when they rode away in
such haste. Hippy thought that he and Tom
could protect their camp and care for Sam at the
same time, and perhaps, by the following day,
there would be help from the Circle O ranch.</p>

<p>Tom reminded him, that, not knowing where
they were, no assistance could be looked for from
that direction. This had not occurred to Hippy.</p>

<p>Pete and Idaho did not return until just before
dark. They had found not the slightest trace
of the other guide, but they were delighted to
see Sam sitting up. Nothing had been seen of the
rustlers, but Two-gun Pete advised that the party
move out of the cabin and go into camp farther
up in the mountains, as otherwise they were more
than likely to be attacked before morning.</p>

<p>Hippy and Tom moved Sam with some misgivings,
but the old guide stood the ride without
admitting the slightest suffering because of it.
That night they made camp without building a
fire, and lay down in the open, deciding that in
the morning they would return to the cabin
and again make it their headquarters while continuing
the search for Jim.</p>

<hr class='tbk' />

<p>In the meantime the long absence of the party
was beginning to cause the Overland girls and
Bindloss some worry, for not knowing where their
companions had gone, it was not possible to get
into communication with them.</p>

<p>By the following morning worry had grown
into genuine alarm, and ways and means for
doing something were discussed by the rancher
and his guests. No conclusion was arrived at, but
shortly after luncheon their hopes were raised by
a dust cloud down the valley. The cloud soon
grew into a horse and rider, and as it neared them
the rider was recognized as Judy. She was coming
fast—her mustang running at top speed.</p>

<p>“Judy’s excited about something,” said Bindloss,
a frown wrinkling his forehead.</p>

<p>The same thought was in the mind of each
Overland Rider. Perhaps Judy was bringing news
from the party that went in search of Stacy and
Jim.</p>

<p>The mountain girl indulged in no fancy horsemanship
that afternoon. She rode straight up
to the porch of the ranch-house and threw herself
from the saddle.</p>

<p>“Give me a drink of water. I’ve swallered a
quart of dust,” was her greeting.</p>

<p>“Is—is anything wrong?” begged Nora.</p>

<p>“Mebby everythin’ is. Hello, Pap Bindloss.
Ain’t grown any better lookin’ since I was here,
be you?”</p>

<p>“What’s the matter, Judy?” he asked, ignoring
her fling at him. “I know something is wrong.”</p>

<p>She gave him a quick flashing look.</p>

<p>“You see too dad-gasted much for an old man.
Ah-h-h-h! That water tastes good. Where’s yer
folks, Miss Gray?” she asked casually, and
emptied the glass of water.</p>

<p>“They went into the mountains to look for
Stacy Brown and Jim. We haven’t seen them
since, and we are worried,” replied Grace.</p>

<p>“A-huh! How’d they know whar to go?”</p>

<p>No one answered, and Judy gave them a quick
searching look.</p>

<p>“Tryin’ to hide up on me, eh? Wal, I don’t
reckon as it’s any good for you to do so, ’cause
mebby I can tell ye some things that may be good
fer ye to know.”</p>

<p>“You know something about them, Judy?”
demanded Miss Briggs.</p>

<p>“A-huh. Did they go up to Red Gulch?”</p>

<p>“Yes, yes!” cried the girls in chorus. “Judy,
do you know where that place is?” questioned
Emma.</p>

<p>“Reckon I could find it if I tried, but I don’t
reckon whether I want to try or not. It’s a long,
hard hike up thar, and thar won’t be no picnic
when you get thar. My Pap says it ain’t a fit
place fer folks to be, but Pap was mad with me
afore he went away this mornin’ and threatened
to give me a punch in the jaw, but he changed his
mind when I pulled my gun and told him to try
it. Wal, Pap didn’t. He went away madder’n a
busting bronco. Said he wouldn’t be back fer a
few days. He said some things ’bout ye folks
that I don’t ’low nobody to say ’bout my friends,
an’ I said so right out in meetin’, and added a
few other things, and that started the row. Say,
I got some news fer you folks.”</p>

<p>“Then for heaven’s sake tell it!” begged
Emma. “You are killing us with suspense.”</p>

<p>“I reckoned that way,” nodded the girl. “Wal,
I heard it this mornin’ fer the first time, ’bout
your folks goin’ up in the mountains, and why
they went thar and all ’bout it. Funny, wasn’t
it, that I should hear it? I ain’t going to tell you
whar I heard it, but I did. You don’t reckon
anythin’ happened to them, do you, Pap Bindloss?”</p>

<p>“Judy, I think you can answer that question,
and that you have come here to help my friends,”
replied the rancher.</p>

<p>“Fer why do ye think that?”</p>

<p>The rancher pointed to the rifle in Judy’s
saddle boot.</p>

<p>“Are you going hunting, Judy?” he asked
significantly.</p>

<p>Judy flushed and turned to the girls.</p>

<p>“I reckon I better tell ye now what I come
heah to say—what I heard this mornin’. Wal,
it was this way: Your folks and some rustlers
had a fight in the mountains last night. It warn’t
much of a fight, but I heard that Sam Conifer
had been killed and thet Miss Gray’s husband and
Hippy had been shot and that there was liable to
be trouble at Red Gulch, and I reckoned that I
was your friend and that you folks needed a
friend right now, and that’s why Judy Hornby is
heah.”</p>

<p>Nora Wingate, uttering a moan, toppled over in
a swoon, the other Overland girls gazing at the
mountain girl in a stunned sort of way, while
Judy fumbled awkwardly with her sombrero.</p>
</div>

<div class='chapter'>
<h2 id='chXXII' title='XXII: RIDERS OF THE NIGHT'>
<span>CHAPTER XXII</span><br />
<span>RIDERS OF THE NIGHT</span>
</h2>

<p>No heed was given to Nora Wingate’s
faint, and for several seconds no one
spoke.</p>

<p>“Gosh a-mighty!” exploded Joe Bindloss.</p>

<p>“Judy, are you positive that your information
is correct?” asked Grace in a voice well under
control.</p>

<p>“Ain’t positive of nothin’. Be you?”</p>

<p>Grace shook her head and smiled faintly.</p>

<p>“Mr. Bindloss, of course we shall have to go.
None of us can stay back now. Judy, will you
guide us to the Red Gulch section?”</p>

<p>“That’s what I’m heah for, Miss Gray. I
reckoned as you’d be doin’ jest that. If I had a
man I’ll bet I’d hit the trail fer him when I heard
he was in a mess. How did yours ever git up to
Red Gulch?”</p>

<p>“He followed the pigeons,” answered Grace.</p>

<p>“A-huh!”</p>

<p>Joe Bindloss, at this juncture, announced his
intention of accompanying the Overlanders into
the mountains. He did not know where Red
Gulch was, but if Judy said she knew, that settled
it. The girls brightened at his suggestion, and
Nora sat up pale and trembling, asking what had
happened.</p>

<p>She was told that she had fainted. Grace
turned to Judy and asked if they were to start
at once, but the mountain girl shook her head.</p>

<p>“We got to wait till night and make a night
ride,” she said. “Pap Bindloss knows why.”</p>

<p>“Oh, I can’t wait!” wailed Nora.</p>

<p>“Judy is right,” spoke up the ranchman.
“Besides, we have some things to do here. I
can’t spare any men from the range, so we shall
have to do the work ourselves. We must break
your camp and store your equipment, for the
rustlers will discover, after we leave here, that
the ranch is unguarded and come down on it.
Understand?”</p>

<p>Grace nodded. Judy tethered her pony and
announced that she would assist them, and the
work of striking the Overland camp began. The
equipment was packed for moving, but instead
of being lashed to the backs of mustangs, Joe
Bindloss carted it to the ranch-house on his buckboard.
The work took a good part of the afternoon,
following which the rancher rode out to
his nearest grazing grounds where he acquainted
one of his foremen with the situation.</p>

<p>Judy Hornby not only did her share of the
work, but kept up the spirits of her companions
with quaint sayings and sharp-witted replies
to questions.</p>

<p>Food sufficient for their needs was packed, and
by supper time all was in readiness for the start.
Before leaving, the mountain girl and the rancher
held a brief consultation, at which she told him
of her plan. Bindloss agreed to it. Up to this
time Judy had given her friends no further information
as to the source of the news that had
come to her, though occasional attempts had been
made by Grace and Elfreda to draw it from her.</p>

<p>The start was made shortly after dark, the
riders setting out in pairs at some little distance
apart. Judy kept to the base of the foothills
where the mountains cast a heavy shadow so that
the movements of the party could not be seen from
the valley in the light of the new moon. Instead
of riding directly into the hills, the mountain girl
rode parallel with them for fully five miles. Grace
asked her why she did this instead of taking the
direct line that had been followed by the carrier
pigeons.</p>

<p>“Mebby that trail is watched,” answered Judy.
“We got to go ’round and come up by a longer
way. You folks leave that to me. I ain’t sayin’
that we ain’t goin’ to be caught, but if we are we
got rifles and I knows how to use mine.”</p>

<p>“So do we,” returned Grace. “I hope it may
not be necessary, though.”</p>

<p>Finally a sharp turn into the mountains was
made, and for a mile or two Judy followed a gash
in the hills.</p>

<p>“We got to climb now,” finally announced their
guide, and it proved to be a real climb. A brief
halt was made to rest the animals, after which
the journey was resumed. The going from there
on was over rough ground, and it was a marvel
to the Overland Riders how Judy Hornby picked
her way in the darkness and kept in the right
direction.</p>

<p>As a matter of fact Judy was using the stars
for her guide, which enabled her to follow the
general direction in which she wanted to go.</p>

<p>Another halt was made at midnight. The girls
were shivering, and Emma asked if they could not
build a fire and warm up.</p>

<p>“No! You’ll git warmed up before you git
through with this,” answered Judy. “Might git
warm most any time now.”</p>

<p>No halt was made from that time until just
at break of day. Then Judy left the party for
half an hour to take an observation. She returned
briskly and announced that they could
make a small fire and have coffee, but she built
the fire herself, being careful not to make enough
smoke to attract attention.</p>

<p>“Folks, we aire within a mile of the Red Gulch,
and I reckon you better keep your eyes open from
now on. I’ll ride on ahead, so watch me. Pap
Bindloss, you watch the sides and the trail behind.
Nobody do any loud talkin’,” advised Judy,
after they had warmed their hands by the little
cook-fire, and drunk their hot coffee. All mounted
and rode away much refreshed, and with a gentle
glow now suffusing their bodies.</p>

<p>The Overlanders now observed that Judy had
unlimbered her rifle, so they did the same, carrying
their weapons resting across their saddles, gun butts
to the right. Judy wound in and out among
the rocks and trees, sometimes being out of sight
for a moment or two, then coming into view
again, until finally she held up her hand and sat
listening. The others halted near where her pony
stood nibbling at the green leaves within its
reach.</p>

<p>“You all stay right heah. I’m going on to
scout ’round a little. Pap, you stay with the
girls.” Judy tossed her bridle-rein to him and
slid from her saddle, taking her rifle with her.
She was out of sight in a few moments, and the
Overland Riders sat in uneasy silence straining
their ears for warning sounds.</p>

<p>When Judy returned her face wore a perplexed
expression.</p>

<p>“Folks, they ain’t there.”</p>

<p>“Aren’t where?” asked Miss Briggs.</p>

<p>“Whar they was supposed to be. I got a good
look at the cabin, but couldn’t see nobody, an’
couldn’t find any ponies anywhar ’bout, though
I see whar they’d been tethered. Would you folks
know the tracks of yer horses?”</p>

<p>Grace said she did not think they would, not
having had these animals long enough to be
familiar with them.</p>

<p>“I can pick ’em out,” volunteered Bindloss.</p>

<p>“Good! Come with me. You folks kin ride
up so you kin see the place whar the cabin is
an’—”</p>

<p>“What cabin?” questioned Emma.</p>

<p>“One of the places whar the rustlers hang out,
an’ whar I reckons that battle was fought. But
you got to keep quiet.”</p>

<p>Bindloss dismounted and followed the girl,
leaving the Overlanders alone and very much
worried. The couple were gone for some time;
then the Riders saw them returning, the rancher
striding rapidly along, Judy following him
thoughtfully.</p>

<p>“They’ve gone, folks!” he announced.
“Neither hide nor hair of them left. I got into
the cabin, and there was bullet holes, fresh ones,
showing that there had been some shooting there.
I reckon there was blood on the floor. It looked
like it.”</p>

<p>“Anything else?” asked Grace, regarding him
keenly.</p>

<p>“Nothing like what you mean,” answered
Bindloss understandingly. “I found the tracks
of my ponies, and we ain’t far from their trail
right this minute. It looks to me as if your party
has headed for home, and Judy agrees with me.
There was five ponies in that bunch and they was
all mine. That looks mighty queer to me.”</p>

<p>“Is it not possible that it was not our friends
who were riding the animals?” asked Miss Briggs.</p>

<p>“I reckon so,” returned the rancher absently.
“However, there’s only one thing for us to do,
and that is to follow the tracks and watch out.”</p>

<p>While he was speaking, Judy had started off
on foot. She was gone for some time. Upon her
return she announced that she had picked up the
trail, and mounting, she directed her companions
to fall in behind her. Bindloss rode a little to
one side of the mountain girl, and in a few minutes
she pointed out the trail to him. He got down
to examine it, and said the faint hoof-prints were
those of ponies from his corral.</p>

<p>From that time on fairly rapid progress was
made, until the trail grew more difficult to follow.
There were straggling cedars about them and on
beyond a forest of pines that formed a great green
canopy. The season had been dry and the long
mountain grass under the sun’s rays had burned
to a dull brown, but the grass was tough and
traveling through it made it necessary for the
ponies to lift their feet high, giving a jolting
effect to the riders that was extremely trying.</p>

<p>Bindloss suddenly halted.</p>

<p>“I hear shooting!” he exclaimed.</p>

<p>“So do I,” agreed Grace.</p>

<p>The reports sounded far away, but Bindloss
and Judy knew that the firing was not so far away
as the Overlanders believed.</p>

<p>“Do you know where you are—do you know
the mountains here?” asked the rancher.</p>

<p>Judy shook her head and said she had never
been so far into the mountain country before, but
that she had a general idea of where they were.
Suddenly she wheeled her pony and started away
towards the scene of the firing, as well as she
was able to locate it. The others followed, each
with straining ears and tingling nerves. They
were soon rewarded by the realization that they
were rapidly approaching the gunfire. Bindloss
halted them with a gesture, and sat listening.
The party was only now at the edge of the pine
forest along which they had been skirting, but
there were pines to the right and left of them,
beautiful, fragrant pines, nodding to the stiff
mountain breeze that was blowing. The wind
died down, then sprang up again from a different
direction.</p>

<p>Judy’s mustang whirled, threw up its head and
snorted, and the pony ridden by the rancher began
to buck under the restraining grip on the bridle-rein
and sundry jabs from the spur, while the
mounts of the Overlanders showed signs of panic.</p>

<p>A moment more and every mustang in the
party was sniffing the air and snorting. Bindloss,
leaning forward in his saddle, gazing back over
the ground that they had covered, saw that a
curtain of bluish shade had been drawn over their
late trail. The curtain was quivering, punctuated
here and there by faint spurts of red.</p>

<p>Judy Hornby’s mustang uttered a whistling
blast of fear, and reared on its hind legs.</p>

<p>“Fire!” cried the mountain girl. “They’ve
set the grass on fire!”</p>

<p>“Ride!” yelled Joe Bindloss. “It’s coming
fast!”</p>

<span>RACING WITH DEATH</span>
</h2>

<p>None knew better than the rancher and
the mountain girl the peril that lay
behind that waving, quivering blue
haze. The only avenue open to them lay by way
of the dark aisles between the pines, for the blue
haze, as they quickly discovered, had crept up
on either side as well as to the rear of them.</p>

<p>“Into the forest!” shouted Bindloss, giving his
pony rein, while Judy held in her bucking mount
until her companions got under way.</p>

<p>The Overland girls were too frightened to start,
but their mustangs, taking matters into their own
hands, lunged forward and were in amongst the
pines a few seconds later, dodging here and there
to avoid trees, until their riders were clinging
with knees and hands to keep from being unseated.</p>

<p>A thin streak of yellow smoke wriggled overhead,
followed by a crackling, hissing sound, and
the wind whipping in the tree tops carried the
smoke on ahead. The fire had overtaken them,
had run up the trunks of the trees at the edge
of the forest, and was leaping from tree to tree
over the heads of the Overland Riders, while here
and there to the rear great pines exploded with
terrifying sounds.</p>

<p>The Overland Riders, despite their torturing
fear, were thrilled. The blood beat in their
temples and their hearts were pounding. They
began to understand what this race meant—it
was a race with death, and its long arms were
waving above them waiting to swoop down and
enfold its victims.</p>

<p>“Faster!” Judy’s shrill command was plainly
heard above the roar. She turned in her saddle
and beckoned to her companions, not certain that
they had heard. It was then she saw that the
haze was enveloping them and that the outlines
of horses and riders were growing fainter. Judy
reined in her mount and waited.</p>

<p>“Ride faster! Use the spur! Drive ’em!
Drive ’em!” she yelled as the girls swept past
her, each one now urging on her mount with
sharp cries. The riders now plainly felt the heat,
the breath of the fire on their cheeks. So did
the horses feel it, and they were frantic.</p>

<p>The tough little mustangs as they swept on
needed no urging. They were giving all that
was in them to save their own lives, but it
seemed to be an unequal battle. The Overland
Riders were not panic-stricken, but a great fear
was in their hearts, yet not one gave way to her
feelings. Perhaps it was because they had no
time to do so, for it required close attention to
prevent being unhorsed as their ponies made
sudden swerves to avoid fallen trees or low hanging
branches. The Overland girls were thus
kept fully occupied, and it was plain to Judy
Hornby that they were in no danger of losing
their heads.</p>

<p>Above the noise, she and Bindloss again heard
the crack of rifles. It was a scattering fire, but
it was fast. Occasionally an interval would occur,
during which the firing seemed to cease, to be
resumed again a moment later.</p>

<p>“They are riding ahead of us. Look out!”
shouted the rancher, swerving close to the mountain
girl.</p>

<p>Judy nodded, and spurred on until she was
abreast of the racing pony of Elfreda Briggs, who
had lost her hat, and whose hair was whipping in
the air behind her.</p>

<p>“Something going on ahead! Watch out!
Watch me fer orders. Tell the others. I got to
git ahead ag’in,” directed Judy.</p>

<p>Elfreda shouted the message to Grace, and
Grace passed it to the girl nearest to her, which
proved to be Emma. Nora was too far to one
side to be reached, but her pony could be trusted
to follow the others if any radical change of direction
were taken.</p>

  <p class='sm'>“Ride Faster! Drive ’Em!”</p>
</div>

<p>Daylight suddenly showed faintly through the
haze—the light of an open space. Joe Bindloss
uttered a yell, hoping that they might there find
rock footing and an end of the fire. Instead, his
mustang burst out into a vast brown field, a
grazing ground many acres in extent, from which
rugged passes branched out in the distance.</p>

<p>As the riders emerged close on the heels of the
rancher and Judy, a scene met their gaze that
thrilled them anew.</p>

<p>Two bodies of horsemen, like themselves, were
fleeing from the fire, which for some unknown
reason had not yet leaped into the brown grass
of the grazing range, and as they rode, both bodies
of men were shooting.</p>

<p>It was a battle, a running battle with rifles.</p>

<p>Judy in one quick glance comprehended the
situation and she saw more than did any others
of her party. She knew the men off there were
part of the band of rustlers who for so long had
been a thorn in the side of all honest ranchers
in the two great grazing valleys of the Cosos.
She saw more than that—the verification of
suspicions that she had harbored for some time,
but that had crystallized only twenty-four hours
before.</p>

<p>At about the same instant the Overlanders also
made a discovery. The party of horsemen directly
in front of them were quickly identified.</p>

<p>“It’s the boys!” screamed Nora.</p>

<p>“Ain’t dead, neither,” cried Joe Bindloss.</p>

<p>The Overland Riders pulled down their ponies.</p>

<p>“Keep going!” roared Bindloss.</p>

<p>“If we do we shall be shot!” wailed Nora.</p>

<p>“If you don’t you’ll be roasted!” retorted the
old ranchman.</p>

<p>It was a difficult choice. To go forward meant
that the Overland party would place themselves
directly in the line of fire of the mountain ruffians,
but to hold back meant that the forest fire in a
few moments would be sweeping over the field.
They decided to go forward, and in a moment
their ponies were racing towards Tom Gray and
his companions.</p>

<p>The fire was now roaring across the brown
meadow. The Overland men saw it and began
drawing in on the rustlers, driving at them in
an oblique line, firing as they put their ponies
at top speed. The girls followed at one side of the
line of fire, hoping thereby to escape being hit.</p>

<p>A rustler toppled from his saddle. At the same
instant Idaho Jones swayed uncertainly in his,
but quickly recovered and again began working
his rifle. Those who saw his hesitation knew that
he had been hit.</p>

<p>The rustlers were now in a thick haze, and were
giving ground as the ranchmen and Overland men
bore down on them, pouring a heavy rifle fire
into the closely bunched outlaws. They saw the
rustlers whirl about facing their assailants to
make a stand, but the firing was too hot for them
and they fled. A mighty yell rose from the
rustlers as all but two of them suddenly disappeared
from sight as if the earth had swallowed
them. It was then that the pursuers discovered
that their adversaries had gained rocky ground.
No forest fire could reach them there.</p>

<p>The two men who were still in view pulled their
ponies to their haunches and swung about facing
each other. The pursuers were amazed to see
both men draw their weapons and begin shooting
at each other.</p>

<p>The Overland men and ranchmen instantly
ceased firing, but continued on at full speed, for
the flames were rapidly sweeping down on them.
They had not yet discovered the presence of Judy
and the Overland girls, but Judy had discovered
that safety from the fire lay at the far side of the
field, so waving a hand for her companions to
follow she headed towards the scene of the savage
duel.</p>

<p>“Oh, it is awful!” cried Emma as her pony
streaked past Miss Briggs and Grace.</p>

<p>Judy was laying her crop over the flank of her
mustang and uttering shrill cries to urge him on,
and the first intimation that the ranchmen had
of the presence of the Overland girls was when
Judy flashed by them towards the duelists.</p>

<p>“Kill ’im, Pap!” she yelled.</p>

<p>“It’s Mex!” shouted Sam Conifer.</p>

<p>At this juncture the Overland girls caught up
with the pursuers and dashed to safety on the
rocky ground. As they reached it Miss Briggs’
pony went down and Grace’s mustang leaped
clear over her and her mount before she could
check him. Tom Gray hurried to the rescue of
Elfreda.</p>

<p>“You here?” he cried.</p>

<p>The roar of the fire, as it swept past over the
brown meadow, smothered the words.</p>

<p>One duelist, at this juncture, was seen to sway
in his saddle, and at the same instant the other
plunged headlong to the ground. The first man’s
pony jumped and he too was unhorsed, then both
duelists laboriously raised themselves to their
elbows, and the duel was resumed. At the second
exchange of shots, one sank back and lay still.</p>

<p>Judy jumped her pony forward, and throwing
herself from the saddle ran to the living man and
pillowed his head in her lap.</p>

<p>“Gosh a-mighty!” roared Bindloss.</p>

<p>The men of the ranch party were on the scene
in a few seconds, but still being ignorant of the
cause of the sudden disappearance of the body of
rustlers kept their weapons at ready. Some of
them now rode cautiously forward to see what had
become of the missing men.</p>

<p>“Stop!” shouted Two-gun Pete. “I know
whar they’ve went to. The gang forgot ’bout the
gulch thar, if they knowed ’bout it at all. Leastwise,
they didn’t see it in the smoke till it war too
late, an’ over they went. They won’t rustle no
more steers, I reckons, bad luck to ’em.”</p>

<p>The whole party was now gathered about
the mountain girl. The dead man, those who
now knew him, was identified as Mexican Charlie.</p>

<p>“It’s Pap,” said Judy when they peered down
into the face of the man whose head lay in her
lap. She gazed up at the Overland girls with a
pitiful look in her face.</p>

<p>Hornby opened his eyes, recognized her and
began to speak.</p>

<p>“That’s all right, Pap. Don’t say it,” begged
Judy.</p>

<p>“I got ter talk, Kid. I’m sorry I made ye mad
yesterday. I told ye thet them friends of yours
war shot at Red Gulch ’cause I knew the rest of
their gang would be up heah, an’ we’d git ’em
all. I wish we had! I wish we had, but the
boys got looney ’cause your friends could shoot
better’n they could, and ran over the edge.”</p>

<p>“Why did you an’ Mex fight, Pap?” asked
Judy.</p>

<p>“’Cause he said I’d double-crossed him, an’
sent his gang to death to git rid of ’em, too. Then
we fit. He set the fire, but I told him to.”</p>

<p>“Oh, Pap! How could you? These folks
ain’t never meant you no harm. They ain’t done
nothin’ but fight when you made ’em,” protested
the mountain girl.</p>

<p>“Yes, they did! They come up heah lookin’
fer trouble. They wanted to drive us out er
business. I know ’cause I had it from a feller
who knowed. An’ ye helped ’em, Judy!” he exclaimed,
blazing up into her face with something
of the old fire in his eyes.</p>

<p>“You bet I did, Pap. My friends is my friends,
an’ I’d do it ag’in,” she answered calmly.</p>

<p>“I don’t bear ye no grudge fer thet now, Kid,
’cause it’s too late. I got mine this time, an’
I’m goin’ out the way I always reckoned I would,
with my boots on an’ facin’ the crack o’ the
guns.”</p>

<p>As he talked, Hornby’s voice grew halting, and
there were pauses of a few seconds between words.
It was plain to all that he was weakening fast.</p>

<p>“May I try to do something for him, Judy?”
begged Miss Briggs gently, as she bent over the
wounded rustler.</p>

<p>“<i>No!</i>” Hornby put all the strength that he
could summon into that one word. “Ye been
lookin’ fer the man who war the leader of the
rustlers. Heah he is! I’m thet man, and as it’s
my dyin’ words, I beat ’em all at the game. Git
ba—ack thar!” The rustler groped with uncertain
fingers for his weapon, whereupon Judy
laid a firm hand on his arm.</p>

<p>“No, Pap! You’ve done enough,” rebuked the
girl. “You’ve said enough, too, an’ Judy Hornby
never again kin hold her head up nor look honest
folks in the face. They’ll say her Pap was a
rustler an’—an’—”</p>

<p>“Judy! Please don’t,” begged Grace. “He
is dying!”</p>

<p>“I—I reckon you’re right.” Judy fell to
stroking the outlaw’s hair. “That’s all right,
Pap. You’re my Pap. Miss Gray is right.”</p>

<p>“No! I got ter tell ye while I can. Judy, I
ain’t yer Pap. Nor yer mother warn’t yer
mother. I stole ye when ye war a little thing
cause the man who was yer Pap had done me
dirt. We raised ye, an’ Judy, we havin’ no
children of our own, begun to like ye fer yerself
an’ we kept ye, though at first we didn’t reckon on
doin’ jest that. We reckoned on gettin rid—”</p>

<p>“No—ot my Pap?” stammered the girl.
“Who, then—who is my Pap?” cried Judy.
“Tell me! Ye got ter tell me! Who is my
Pap?” Her voice rose threateningly, then sank
almost to a whisper. “Pap, dear! Who is my
real Pap?”</p>

<p>“He—he—he war—”</p>

<p>The voice grew faint, and though the girl bent
her ear close to the lips of the dying man, she
failed to catch the whispered words, and the secret
that Malcolm Hornby had kept for so many years
died with him there by the scorched meadows of
the Cosos over which, like a shroud, hung a
suffocating pall of yellow smoke.</p>

<p>Old Joe Bindloss lifted the little mountain girl
to her feet, and, with hands on her shoulders,
brought her face to face with him.</p>

<p>“I ain’t got no Pap now,” she murmured. “I
ain’t got no friends, no nothin’ that a girl wants
so much.”</p>

<p>Grace Harlowe slipped an arm about her.</p>

<p>“Yes, you have, Judy. We are your friends,
now and always,” said Grace gently. “And I
think you have a Pap that you haven’t reckoned
on,” she added, nodding towards Joe Bindloss.</p>

<p>For a moment the old rancher and the mountain
girl stood gazing into each other’s eyes, then he
drew her, unresisting, to him and lightly touched
her forehead with his lips.</p>

<p>“Oh, Pap!” sobbed Judy, her arms slipping
about the neck of Old Joe Bindloss as she buried
her head on his shoulder.</p>

<h2 id='chXXIV' title='XXIV: FAREWELL TO THE COSOS'>
<span>CHAPTER XXIV</span><br />
<span>FAREWELL TO THE COSOS</span>
</h2>

<p>The Overland Riders and the men from
the Circle O ranch walked to the edge
of the precipice and looked down. The
girls shivered and quickly turned, facing the other
way, while the men gazed solemnly into the
abyss.</p>

<p>“How’dy, folks,” greeted Jim. “Ain’t seen ye
fer a week o’ Sundays. Ye see that no ’count
pard o’ mine got his’n,” he chuckled, nodding at
Sam, whose head was still swathed in bandages.</p>

<p>“Yes, but what happened to you?” questioned
Emma. “It would appear that you too got
something.”</p>

<p>Jim explained that he had been roped from his
pony, carried into the mountains and secreted in
a cave where the pigeon cotes were located. It
was the wire-covered pigeon-yard just outside of
the cave, well masked with foliage, that the Overland
men and the ranchers, in their hunt for Jim,
had stumbled upon, and that led to finding the
missing guide. That was where the outlaws
caught them, and, had not the men from the ranch
been on the alert, would have made a quick
finish of them.</p>

<p>Tom told the Overlanders of Sam’s battle with
the rustlers in the mountain cabin, of the further
search for Jim, and of the culminating experience
when a running battle with the rustlers was
engaged in.</p>

<p>“Stacy!” cried Nora in sudden recollection.
In the excitement of that memorable morning she
had forgotten about the fat boy.</p>

<p>“He got away the night we come up heah,”
Sam Conifer informed her. “I reckons he’s got
home afore this, an’ that he’ll stay thar. They
was goin’ to drop him into Red Gulch, an’ I
reckon he thought it war time to leave.”</p>

<p>At this juncture, Miss Briggs asked permission
to look at the wounds of the party. Sam’s
wounds were doing well, but needed professional
care, which Elfreda gave to them on the spot.
She next dressed Idaho Jones’ arm, which was
bleeding from a bullet wound. Barring a few
slight flesh wounds where bullets had narrowly
missed doing serious injury, the other fighters
were unharmed.</p>

<p>“You now have the whole story,” announced
Tom Gray, as she finished. “The rustlers, thanks
to their own carelessness, have taken a bad job
out of our hands.”</p>

<p>“What a terrible death!” breathed Grace.
“What about these?” she added, pointing to
Mexican Charlie and Malcolm Hornby. “Shall
I consult Judy about—about her fa—about
Hornby?”</p>

<p>Tom shook his head.</p>

<p>“You girls go on and take care of her. We
will do all that is necessary to be done,” he made
reply.</p>

<p>The Overland girls returned to Bindloss and the
mountain girl, who was clinging to the hand of
the old rancher, a deep pallor showing under the
tan on her face. Emma slipped a hand into hers,
and Judy turned a wan face to the little Overland
girl, but the face wore a faint smile.</p>

<p>“It’s all fixed, Emma,” she said, nodding.
“I’m Judy Bindloss now. Leastwise I’m goin’ to
be as soon as my new Pap kin git the papers
made out. I don’t see no reason fer doin’ that,
do you?”</p>

<p>Miss Briggs, as a lawyer, tried to explain to her
why it was very necessary, but the mountain girl
shook her head.</p>

<p>“He’s my Pap. It seems like he always was
and no papers can’t make him more so. Pap,
let’s go home.”</p>

<p>The ponies were led along for some distance,
to give them rest while the party were talking,
and for the further purpose of giving the men
back there opportunity to do their work and join
the Overland Riders.</p>

<p>The party finally being complete, Pete led the
way across the blackened landscape to the old
cabin. Reaching there, they laid up for a rest,
and after luncheon Judy told them the story of
her father, Malcolm Hornby, so far as she knew
it.</p>

<p>Certain recent occurrences had made her suspect
that Hornby was in league with the rustlers, but
the night before she brought warning to the
Overland girls that Tom and Hippy were
wounded, she heard a conversation between her
father and Mexican Charlie in which her suspicion
became a certainty. From that conversation she
learned that much stock had been stolen from
Bindloss, and that by making a “Q” out of the
Circle O ranch brand and adding another “Q,”
the marking conformed with Hornby’s brand,
after which the stolen cattle were added to his own
herd. He had, with the assistance of the mountain
ruffians, carried on wholesale thievery in two
great valleys for several years and made money.
His reward had been reaped that day, and it had
been coming for some time, because Mexican
Charlie and he were rapidly nearing the breaking
point just before the last attack on the Overland
Riders, who were the indirect cause of breaking
up the gang of mountain ruffians.</p>

<p>That there were others of the gang still at large
the ranchmen knew, but Judy could give them
no information on this point. It was decided,
therefore, to ask the aid of the sheriff and his
deputies, as well as that of other ranchers, to
form a big party and comb the mountains for the
other ruffians, who, now that the backbone of the
band had been broken, could be driven more easily
from that region, and perhaps some of them
captured.</p>

<p>In the early afternoon the journey home was
begun. Judy did not accompany them all the
way, saying that she wished to stop at her former
home and get some personal belongings, she
promising to ride back to the Circle O ranch on
the following morning. Judy wished to be alone
that night, and the Overland girls, at least,
understood.</p>

<p>Circle O was reached before dark, and Stacy
Brown, who had gained entrance to the ranch-house,
which he had reached only a few hours
before, met them at the door. The “fat boy”
was thin, there were hollows in his cheeks, and a
livid mark on the left cheek where a bullet had
left its trail.</p>

<p>Stacy had been hunted all the way across the
mountains, and shot at on several occasions, but
had always outwitted his pursuers until finally
they gave up the man-hunt and returned to the
Diamond Bar ranch. Hungry and worn out and
after considerable suffering he finally reached
Circle O only to find it deserted and the Overland
camp broken up.</p>

<p>Now, however, that the opportunity was at
hand to glorify his own achievements, Stacy
Brown made the most of it, and out in the yard
in front of the ranch-house, he declaimed loudly
on his own prowess in fooling his pursuers.</p>

<p>Stacy was still engaged in this before an
interested audience when a rider approached from
the valley, but no one gave heed to him, believing
him to be one of Bindloss’s men. The rider dismounted
at the stable and walked towards the
group, his eyes fixed on Chunky. He halted just
behind the boy and stood regarding him
frowningly.</p>

<p>“Well, sir, what is it?” demanded Joe Bindloss
sharply.</p>

<p>Stacy, in the midst of a loud boast, turned to
look at the man behind him. The words died on
his lips as he came face to face with the newcomer.
It was Skip, the fellow on whose head
Stacy had brought down the wagon stake at the
Diamond Bar ranch.</p>

<p>The Overland boy’s face grew a shade paler,
and he made a move as if to run, but the pressure
of a revolver against his stomach sent the shivers
up and down his back and literally froze him.</p>

<p>“Here! Here!” roared Joe Bindloss. “What
do ye mean?”</p>

<p>“This feller’s a hoss thief. We kotched him on
a hoss that had been rustled from the Diamond
Bar ranch. He got away by cloutin’ me over the
haid. We follered, but he was too slippery fer
us. I been lookin’ fer him ever since, an’ now
I’ve got him!”</p>

<p>“Put down thet gun, pard!” drawled Sam
Conifer, and Skip found himself gazing at the
muzzle of the old guide’s weapon. “Put it down,
I says!”</p>

<p>The caller shoved his weapon into its holster,
and Stacy Brown drew a long breath of relief and
then quickly stepped back a few paces.</p>

<p>“This man is no more a thief than you are!”
exploded Bindloss. “He is one of my friends,
and that’s all there is to it.”</p>

<p>“I got to take him back,” persisted Skip
stubbornly.</p>

<p>“Listen to me, young fellow!” commanded
Bindloss, who thereupon repeated the story that
Chunky had told them, adding further information
of his own.</p>

<p>“Thet’s what the critter told us back at the
ranch. We reckoned he lied, an’ I reckon so too.”</p>

<p>“Drop thet talk!” warned Sam Conifer.</p>

<p>Joe Bindloss after some farther argument told
the visitor that he would write a letter to Bill
Crawley, owner of the Diamond Bar ranch, fully
explaining the matter, but in no circumstances
would Skip be permitted to take Stacy with him.</p>

<p>“And that’s flat!” finished the rancher
sternly.</p>

<p>“Thet’s all right, Boss, but what ’bout this?”
he demanded, exhibiting the lump that Stacy had
left on the top of his head. “I got ter have satersfaction
fer thet, I reckon.”</p>

<p>“I’ll hit it again if you say so,” offered Stacy,
but the boy met a quick rebuke from his
companions.</p>

<p>“Look here, my man! How much do you
want for satisfaction?” interjected Tom Gray.</p>

<p>“Wal, I reckon ’bout two bucks’ll satersfy
me,” answered Skip, tenderly caressing the lump.</p>

<p>“Stacy, shell out! Give the man two dollars,”
ordered Lieutenant Wingate. Stacy demurred,
but there was no avoiding payment. He tried
to borrow the money, but not one of the Overlanders
would give him a cent, so Stacy Brown
reluctantly parted with two silver dollars.</p>

<p>The letter was written by Grace at Bindloss’s
dictation, and half an hour later Skip headed back
towards the Diamond Bar ranch, not only with
the letter and two silver dollars in his pocket, but
with a request from Bindloss that Bill Crawley
and his men join with the Circle O men in making
a final drive on the rustlers.</p>

<p>It was early to bed that night at the Circle O,
for all hands were worn out. On the following
morning the girls had a long talk with Joe
Bindloss. It was decided that the Overlanders
should remain at the ranch while the ranchers
drove out the last of the rustlers.</p>

<p>Judy came in in time for luncheon that day.
The girls saw that she had been weeping, but
made no comment. It was then that they
broached the subject that had been discussed with
Judy’s new “Pap.” Grace and Elfreda wished to
take her back east with them and show her some
of the world that she had so often dreamed of
seeing.</p>

<p>At first Judy was obdurate, but the thought
grew and Bindloss urged, so, before the departure
of the Overlanders two weeks later, Judy had said
“yes.”</p>

<p>The drive of the ranchers proved successful in
ridding the Cosos of rustlers, though only one man
was captured. The others had fled, following the
disaster to Hornby and his immediate gang, and
the drive of the ranchers.</p>

<p>The journey of the Overland party, following
the recovery of Hippy and Sam from their wounds,
lasted until mid-September when the great day in
Judy’s life arrived. The Overland Riders had
returned to the ranch to pick her up, and to
arrange for returning Joe Bindloss’s ponies to him
at the railroad station, and, after a day’s rest at
the ranch-house, they set out for the east—and
home. Judy wavered at the last moment, but
finally rode away with her friends, waving her
sombrero to the rugged old rancher, and trying to
laugh through her tears. The world that Judy
had so yearned for lay just before her, and after
a winter with the Overland girls she was destined
to return much benefited in every way, but with
a fuller realization that her duty to herself and to
her new “Pap” lay in the beautiful Valley of
the Cosos.</p>

<p>There was still a large measure of adventure
before Grace Harlowe and her young friends, and
to which every member of the party was already
looking forward for the coming season. The
story of these adventures will be related in a
following volume entitled, “<span class='sc'>Grace Harlowe’s
Overland Riders Among the Border Guerrillas</span>,”
where, in the Guadalupe Mountains,
they encounter experiences that make the story
replete with interest that cannot fail to hold the
undivided attention of the reader.</p>

<p>1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your

Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound

<p>1.B. "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this

electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.</p>

<p>1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the
Foundation" or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg-tm License when
you share it without charge with others.</p>

agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg-tm work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country outside the United States.</p>

  are not located in the United States, you'll have to check the laws
  of the country where you are located before using this
  ebook.</p></blockquote>

<p>1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase "Project

posted with the permission of the copyright holder found at the
beginning of this work.</p>

License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.</p>

electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with

Gutenberg-tm License.</p>

<p>1.E.6. You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including

to or distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format
other than "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official
version posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site
(www.gutenberg.org), you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense
to the user, provide a copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means

  the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
  you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
  to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he has
  agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid
  within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are
  legally required to prepare) your periodic tax returns. Royalty
  payments should be clearly marked as such and sent to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the address specified in
  Section 4, "Information about donations to the Project Gutenberg
  Literary Archive Foundation."</li>

<li>You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
  you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
  does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
  License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
  copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
  all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg-tm
  works.</li>

<li>You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of
  any money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the

  receipt of the work.</li>

<li>You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
  distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.</li>
</ul>

<p>1.E.9. If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work or group of works on different terms than

from both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and The
Project Gutenberg Trademark LLC, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark. Contact the Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.</p>

<p>1.F.</p>

<p>1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.</p>

<p>1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.</p>

<p>1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.</p>

warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.</p>

additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.  </p>

<h3 class="pgx" title="Section 2. The Mission of Project Gutenberg">Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm</h3>

<p>Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.</p>

<p>Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org.</p>

<h3 class="pgx" title="Section 4. Donations to PGLAF">Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation</h3>

<p>Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.</p>

<p>The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit <a href="http://www.gutenberg.org/donate">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a>.</p>

<p>While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.</p>

<p>International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.</p>

<p>Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate</p>

<h3 class="pgx" title="Section 5. Project Gutenberg Electronic Works">Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.</h3>

<p>Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.</p>

<p>Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.</p>

<p>Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org</p>

<p>This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.</p>
